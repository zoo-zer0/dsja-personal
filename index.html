        <h1>Cold Plunges for Him</h1>
        <h2>When the For You Page Isn’t for Me</h2>
        <p>by Jooyoung Hyun</p>
        <p>(title kinda cringe right now. super rough draft)</p>
    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>
<b>#Coldplunge</b>—better known as cold showering—is everywhere on my <em>For You Page</em>. It seems like I’m not alone, as Google searches for “cold plunge benefits” have surged by X% since 2020. On YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit, cold plunging has gone from niche recovery ritual to mainstream biohack.
        </p>
        <p>Endorsed by celebrities and my favorite wellness influencers cold plunging is said to offer benefits like ____, ___, and ____, supposedly backed up by scientific research and numerous controlled trials.</p>

        <p>
This was enough to convince me to give it a try. But the moment I stepped in the tub, immersing myself in the ice cold water, there was no shivering, no promised calorie burn like the health blogs claimed; just a pure, overwhelming state of stress. As I endured what felt more painful than therapeutic, I thought to myself: maybe this trend isn't <em>for me.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
Somehow, the scientific evidence behind the flashy YouTube thumbnails and influencer tubs may not be as inclusive as the marketing makes it seem.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, out of 212 PubMed articles that conducted clinical and randomized controlled trials investigating the therapeutic and physiological effects of cold therapy (with abstract available), more than <b><span class = "highlight">50%</span> excluded women from its methodology entirely</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>So how do female bodies get left out of the research, yet featured in the marketing? How does advice based on male-centric studies become universal wellness wisdom?</p>
    <h1>The Flow of Information: from the Lab to Your Feed.</h1>
        <p>Cold plunging didn’t land on my For You Page arbitrarily. It traveled through a lengthy, complex citation pipeline: from controlled trials in academic journals, to systematic reviews, to mainstream health blogs, to celebrity news and TikTok videos. Somewhere along that path, critical details—like who the studies were actually conducted on—disappeared. </p>

            <div class="tree-text">
                <div class="step" data-step="0">
I began tracing this pipeline through a story in The Joseon Ilbo. The article covered a Vogue video featuring Jennie from Blackpink introducing her nightly cold plunging routine.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="1">
Each of these lines represent a source cited in the bubble above, categorized by its stance on cold plunging: 
<span class = "highlight dark-green">beneficial</span>, 
<span class = "highlight dark-red">harmful</span>, 
or <span class="highlight gray">neutral</span>. 
<br><br>
For example, The Joseon Ilbo article lists several benefits—such as reduced pain, improved circulation, and muscle recovery—citing EveryDay Health, A U.S.-based medical newsletter.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="2">
EveryDay Health is generally reputable, with its articles medically reviewed and citations drawn from scientific journals, while remaining accessible to the general public.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="3">
EveryDay Health’s article considers both the benefits and potential harms of cold plunging, but leans more positive. 
<br><br>For example, it mentions benefits such as reduced pain and fatigue, and improved recovery after high-intensity exercise. 
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="4">
These claims are cited from a 2022 systematic review published in <a href="">Sports Medicine</a> that examined 52 studies. 
<br><br>A review paper is a type of scientific study that analyzes findings on a single topic by synthesizing results from multiple previous studies, represented here as a <span class="highlight orange">orange</span> dot.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step = "5">
Each cold-water-immersion trial (a controlled experiment designed to test specific effects) is represented as a dot, colored on a scale from 
<span class = "highlight boy-blue">blue</span>  
to 
<span class="highlight girl-pink">pink</span>: 
the pinker the dot, the greater the female participation rate.
<br><br>You’ll notice a sea of blue dots. Out of those 52 studies, I had access to 32 trials. And out of those 32 trials, <br><strong><span class="highlight">22</span> excluded women entirely.</strong>

                Notice the spike around 2020—when cold plunging became a wellness trend online. But even then, most studies still centered on men.

            <div class="step bar-step" data-step="3">
                Key study in 2019 claimed benefits for recovery—but excluded women entirely.

        <p>
            After digging through 212 PubMed studies on cold-water immersion, I found that more than 50% excluded women entirely. Yet online, these findings are marketed as universal advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here’s what the pipeline looks like: from clinical trial → health review → influencer video. Notice what gets lost along the way.
