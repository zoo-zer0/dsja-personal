Thirty healthy women (23.3 \u00b1 2.9 years) were randomly assigned to either the CWI, HWI, or control (CON) groups. Participants completed a standardised exercise protocol (5 x 20 drop-jumps), followed by a 10\u2009min recovery intervention (CWI, HWI, or CON) immediately and 120\u2009min post-exercise. Physiological responses, including muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2), core and skin temperature, and heart rate, were assessed at baseline, immediately post-exercise, after the first recovery intervention (postInt), and during 30\u2009min follow-up. Recovery was evaluated through maximal voluntary isometric contraction, muscle swelling, muscle soreness ratings, and serum creatine kinase at baseline, 24, 48, and 72\u2009h post-exercise. A mixed-effects model was used to account for repeated measures over time. Results showed lower SmO2 values in the CWI compared to the HWI group at 20\u2009min (\u0394-6.76%, CI: \u22120.27 to \u221213.25, p = 0.038) and 30\u2009min (\u0394-9.86%, CI: \u22123.37 to \u221216.35, p = 0.001), and compared to CON at 30\u2009min (\u0394-7.28%, CI: \u221213.77 to \u22120.79, p = 0.022). Core temperature was significantly higher in the HWI than the CWI group (postInt and 30\u2009min), while it was significantly lower in the CWI group than CON (30\u2009min). CWI caused a substantial decrease in skin temperature compared to HWI and CON between postInt and 30\u2009min follow-up (all p < 0.001). Skin temperature was higher in the HWI group compared to CON at postInt and throughout 30\u2009min follow-up (all p < 0.001). No significant differences in recovery markers were observed between CWI and HWI groups, although HWI led to slightly higher creatine kinase levels (24\u2009h and 72\u2009h) and greater muscle swelling (24\u2009h) compared to CON. Despite distinct acute physiological responses to CWI and HWI, neither improved subjective or objective recovery outcomes during the 72\u2009h follow-up compared to CON in women following a muscle-damaging exercise protocol.\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Wellauer et al.

However, its effectiveness in restoring neuromuscular function remains \ninconclusive. This study examined the impact of CWI on recovery following \nhigh-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Twelve young, recreationally active \nindividuals (10 males, 2 females) participated in a randomized crossover study. \nEach session included six sets of 30-s all-out isokinetic concentric \ncontractions of the ankle dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles, followed by \n10\u2009min of room temperature rest (RT) or CWI at 10\u00b0C. Neuromuscular function and \nintramuscular temperature were evaluated periodically over 24\u2009h, as well as \nnext-day fatigue resistance of the dorsiflexors. In both conditions, maximal \nvoluntary contraction torque remained impaired for up to 3\u2009h without significant \nchanges in voluntary activation (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Electrically stimulated torque \nshowed no difference in the fatigue-induced decline or recovery of 10\u2009Hz torque, \nwhich also remained impaired for up to 3\u2009h. However, 50\u2009Hz torque recovered \nwithin 1\u2009h following RT, whereas it remained slightly reduced for up to 3\u2009h \nfollowing CWI. The 10:50\u2009Hz torque ratio showed immediate recovery with CWI, \nwhereas RT recovery was delayed for up to 1\u2009h. Notably, the ratio was \nsignificantly lower with RT at 0-, 0.5-, and 1-h post-intervention. Despite \nthese differences, HIIE performance during a repeat bout conducted 24\u2009h later \nremained similar.

Despite these \nbenefits, there is emerging evidence to suggest the temperature of the water \nexposure can influence energy intake in the subsequent hours. The study aim was \nto investigate the influence of water temperature on energy expenditure and \npost-water immersion ad-libitum energy intake in resting adults. Participants \nwith a range of body masses, but otherwise healthy and physically active males \n(n = 10) and females (n = 5), participated in three randomised trials in a \nrepeated measures crossover design, with a minimum of 7-days apart. Participants \nwere immersed to sternum level for 30-minutes in either cold-water (16 \u00b0C), \nthermoneutral-water (35 \u00b0C) or a no-water thermoneutral ambient air control (26 \n\u00b0C). Participants completed appetite related visual analogue scales throughout \nand were presented with an ad-libitum homogenous pasta meal and asked to eat \nuntil 'comfortably full'.\nRESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA showed participants consumed more energy after \nimmersion in cold-water (2783 \u00b1 909 kJ) versus both thermoneutral-water (1817 \u00b1 \n862 kJ) and thermoneutral ambient air (1894 \u00b1 233 kJ). There were no differences \nin any of the appetite VAS. Core temperature remained stable throughout the 30 \nmin immersion period across trials, however an after-drop in core temperature \nwas observed for 15 mins following cold-water immersion when compared to both \nthermoneutral water (P < 0.001), and thermoneutral air (P = 0.004). Although the \nexact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, further research is required to \nidentify if the after-drop in core temperature is a potential mechanism \nresponsible for compensatory food intake post cold-water immersion.\nCONCLUSION: When presented with an ad-libitum meal directly after cold-water \nimmersion, participants consumed more in comparison to both thermoneutral water \nimmersion and thermoneutral ambient air. With cold water immersion becoming \npopular, these findings have practical and clinical relevance for individuals' \nconscious about body mass management.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Eighteen \nhealthy adult women were randomly assigned to a CWI group and a control group \n(CG) (n\u00a0=\u00a09\/group). Participants performed 10 sets of 10 repetitions of \nisokinetic EC at 30\u00b0\/second and underwent maximum voluntary isometric \ncontraction (MVC), delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) assessment, straight leg \nraise (SLR) test, and plasma myoglobin (Mb) measurement. The CWI group received \none 14-min session of CWI treatment (14\u00b0C) at 1, 25, 49, 73, and 97\u00a0h after the \nEC test, whereas the CG rested in a seated position at the same five time points \nwithout receiving treatment.

Twenty-three under-20 semi-professionals male soccer players \nwere randomly allocated into cold water immersion group (bathtub with water and \nice at 10\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min) or control group (rest for 10\u00a0min), every day, \nafter training sessions during a preseason. Primary outcome was change in \ncreatine kinase (CK) concentration, and secondary outcomes were changes in \nvertical jump performance, strength and perception of recovery at baseline (T0) \nand after protocol training (T1).\nRESULTS: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant \ntime-group interactions for CK concentration, with an average reduction of \n280.39 U\/L (CI95%\u00a0=\u00a0-519.14, -41.64; d\u00a0=\u00a00.55) in the cold-water immersion \ncompared to the control group. No differences between groups were observed in \nany other measures.\nCONCLUSION: Multiple cold-water immersions at 10\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min decreases CK \nconcentration but does not change any clinical and neuromuscular markers of \nmuscle damage in soccer players during a 9-day preseason.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to compare the \nextent of pain inhibition from exercise-induced hypoalgesia (isometric wall \nsquat), conditioned pain modulation (cold-water immersion), and their \ncombination (wall squat followed by cold water in fixed order) in healthy \npain-free adults. Sixty-one participants (median age 21 years) completed 3 \nsessions (wall-squat, cold-water, and\u00a0combined) in random order. Sessions were \nseparated by at least a week. In each session, pressure-pain thresholds, \nsingle-pinprick-pain ratings, and pinprick-temporal summation of pain (the fifth \nminus the first) were obtained at quadriceps, forearms, and forehead, before and \nafter wall squat and\/or cold water. Each intervention inhibited pain to pressure \n(partial \u03b72 =\u00a0.26) and single pinprick (partial \u03b72 =\u00a0.16) to a similar extent; \nhowever, pressure-pain inhibition was negligible in the forehead. After \nadjusting for age and sex, single-pinprick-pain inhibition in the forehead \ninduced by wall squat was associated with that induced by cold water (adjusted \nR2 =\u00a0.15;\u00a0P\u00a0=\u00a0.007), and stronger pain inhibition was predicted by a higher \nthigh-pain rating to wall squat (adjusted R2 =\u00a0.10;\u00a0P\u00a0=\u00a0.027). Neither \nintervention affected pinprick-temporal summation of pain. Together, the \nfindings suggest that pain-inhibitory effects of exercise-induced hypoalgesia \nand conditioned pain modulation may overlap when exercise is at least moderately \npainful (6\/10 intensity). Pressure pain in body regions remote from the \nexercised or conditioned sites may be weakly modulated. PERSPECTIVE: The current \nfindings suggest that pain-inhibitory effects induced by painful wall squat and \nby cold-water immersion may overlap. The magnitude of pain inhibition in the \nforehead remote from the exercised thigh or the conditioned foot appears \nsmaller, which could be examined further in future research.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 United States Association for the Study of Pain, Inc.

While we recently showed \nthat these strategies do not limit core temperature increases in older adults \nduring prolonged heat exposure, we did observe small reductions in heart rate. \nExpanding on these findings, we examined the effects of foot immersion with and \nwithout neck cooling on cardiac autonomic function. Seventeen adults (9 females; \n65-81 years) underwent 3 randomized, 6 h exposures to 38 \u00b0C and 35% relative \nhumidity with: no cooling (control), foot immersion (20\u00a0\u00b0C water), or foot \nimmersion with a wet towel (20\u00a0\u00b0C) around the neck. Cardiac autonomic responses \nwere measured at baseline and end-exposure. These included heart rate \nvariability, cardiac and systolic blood pressure responses to standing, indexed \nvia the 30:15 ratio and supine-to-standing systolic pressure change, \nrespectively, and baroreflex sensitivity during repeated sit-to-stand maneuvers. \nThe 30:15 ratio was 0.04 [95% CI: 0.01, 0.07] greater with foot immersion and \nneck cooling (1.08 (SD: 0.04)) relative to control (1.04 (0.06); P\u00a0=\u00a00.018). \nSimilarly, standing systolic blood pressure was elevated 9 [0, 17] mmHg with \nfoot immersion and neck cooling (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). That said, neither difference \nremained statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity \n(Padjusted\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.054). No differences in 30:15 ratio or standing systolic blood \npressure were observed with foot immersion alone, while heart rate variability \nand baroreflex sensitivity were unaffected by either cooling intervention.

In a randomized crossover single-blind design, 12 \nhealthy adults (27\u2009\u00b1\u20092 yr, 2 women) completed 1 h of cold (22.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00b0C) HOWI \nbreathing either normobaric normoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.21) or normobaric \nhypoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.14). Free and total thyroxine (T3) and \ntriiodothyronine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were \nmeasured in venous blood samples obtained before (baseline), during (15-, 30-, \nand 60 min), and 15 min following HOWI (post-), and were corrected for changes \nin plasma volume. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and core (rectal) \ntemperature were measured continuously. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was \nlower during hypoxia (90\u2009\u00b1\u20093%) compared with normoxia (98\u2009\u00b1\u20091%, P < 0.001). Core \ntemperature fell from baseline (normoxia: 37.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u00b0C, hypoxia: 37.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u00b0C) \nto post-cold HOWI (normoxia: 36.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C, hypoxia: 36.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C, P < 0.001) in \nboth conditions but did not change differently between conditions (condition \u00d7 \ntime: P = 0.552). Circulating TSH, total T3, free T4, total T3, and free T4 \nconcentrations demonstrated significant main effects of time (all P \u2264 0.024), \nbut these changes did not differ between normoxic and hypoxic conditions \n(condition \u00d7 time: all P \u2265 0.163). These data indicate that acute moderate \nnormobaric hypoxia does not modify the circulating thyroid hormone response \nduring 1 h of cold HOWI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Acute head-out cold (22\u00b0C) water \nimmersion (HOWI) decreased core temperature and increased thermogenesis.

The effects of repeated \npost-resistance exercise water immersion on inflammatory and hormone responses \nin athletes were investigated.\nMETHODS: Male, academy Super Rugby players (n\u2009=\u200918, 19.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 y, 1.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u00a0m, \n98.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7\u00a0kg) participated in a 12-week programme divided into 3 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 4-week \nblocks of post-resistance exercise water immersion (either, no immersion control \n[CON]; cold [CWI]; or hot [HWI] water immersion), utilising a randomised \ncross-over pre-post design. Fasted, morning blood measures were collected prior \nto commencement of first intervention block, and every fourth week thereafter. \nLinear mixed-effects models were used to analyse main (treatment, time) and \ninteraction effects.\nRESULTS: Repeated CWI (p\u2009=\u20090.025, g\u2009=\u20090.05) and HWI (p\u2009<\u20090.001, g\u2009=\u20090.62) \nreduced creatine kinase (CK), compared to CON. HWI decreased (p\u2009=\u20090.013, \ng\u2009=\u20090.59) interleukin (IL)-1ra, compared to CON. HWI increased (p\u2009<\u20090.001-0.026, \ng\u2009=\u20090.06-0.17) growth factors (PDGF-BB, IGF-1), compared to CON and CWI. CWI \nincreased (p\u2009=\u20090.004, g\u2009=\u20090.46) heat shock protein-72 (HSP-72), compared to HWI.\nCONCLUSION: Post-resistance exercise CWI or HWI resulted in trivial and moderate \nreductions in CK, respectively, which may be partly due to hydrostatic effects \nof water immersion. Post-resistance exercise HWI moderately decreased IL-1ra, \nwhich may be associated with post-resistance exercise skeletal muscle \ninflammation influencing chronic resistance exercise adaptive responses. \nFollowing post-resistance exercise water immersion, CWI increased HSP-72 \nsuggesting a thermoregulatory response indicating improved adaptive inflammatory \nresponses to temperature changes, while HWI increased growth factors (PDGF-BB, \nIGF-1) indicating different systematic signalling pathway activation.

The interventions were \nperformed in a randomized order with a 1-week wash-out period. We tested \nathletes before and after each intervention week regarding swim (100\u00a0m freestyle \nsprints) and functional performance (flexibility, upper and lower body power, \nand shoulder proprioception). We monitored athlete's perceptions (well-being, \nheaviness, tiredness, discomfort and pain) during testing sessions using a \n5-item questionnaire. Athlete preferences regarding the interventions were \nassessed at the end of the study. We used generalized linear mixed models and \ngeneralized estimating equations for continuous and categorical variables, \nrespectively (intervention x time).\nRESULTS: We found a time effect for swim performance (p\u2009=\u2009.01) in which, \nregardless the intervention, all athletes improved sprint time at \npost-intervention compared to baseline. There was an intervention effect for \npain (p\u2009=\u2009.04) and tiredness (p\u2009=\u2009.04), but with no significant post-hoc \ncomparisons. We found no significant effects for other outcomes. All athletes \nreported a preference for CWI or TWI in relation to PAS.\nCONCLUSION: The repeated use of CWI throughout a training week did not impact \nfunctional or swim performance outcomes of competitive adolescent swimmers. \nPerceptive outcomes were also similar across interventions; however, athletes \nindicated a preference for both CWI and TWI.\n\n\u00a9 2024.

Twelve national-team skaters (7 males, \n5 females) completed three trials according to a randomized cross-over study. \nFifteen minutes after an exhaustive ice-skating training session, participants \nunderwent 20\u2009min of HWI (41.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C), 15\u2009min of CWI (12.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u00b0C) or 15\u2009min \nof active recovery (AR). After 1 h 30 min of the first exercise, they performed \na repeated-sprint cycling session. Average power output was slightly but \nsignificantly higher for AR (767\u2009\u00b1\u2009179 W) and HWI (766\u2009\u00b1\u2009170 W) compared to CWI \n(738\u2009\u00b1\u2009156 W) (p\u2009=\u20090.026, d\u2009=\u20090.18).

Twelve young non-obese women were randomly \nassigned to undergo the following conditions: 2 days of fasting with two 10-min \nwhole-body cold-water immersions on separate days (FAST-COLD), 2 days of fasting \nwithout cold-water immersions (FAST), 2 days of usual diet with two 10-min \nwhole-body cold-water immersions on separate days (COLD), or 2 days of usual \ndiet without cold-water immersions (CON) in a randomised crossover fashion. \nChanges in REE and substrate utilisation, and glucose tolerance and insulin \nsensitivity from the oral glucose tolerance test were examined. The results \nshowed that FAST-COLD and FAST trials increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) REE and decreased \n(P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) respiratory quotient, but these variables did not differ \nsignificantly between the FAST-COLD and FAST trials. The glucose and insulin \narea under the curves (AUCs) were higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the FAST-COLD and FAST \ntrials than in the CON and COLD trials, and these AUCs were lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in \nthe FAST-COLD than in the FAST trial. Matsuda index was lower in the FAST trial \nthan in the CON trial (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and tended to be greater after the FAST-COLD \ntrial than after the FAST trial (P\u00a0=\u00a00.060).

Before the exercise sessions were performed, countermovement jump (CMJ) \nand heart rate variability were recorded (i.e., rMSSD, low and high frequency \npower and its ratio, SD1 and SD2). Exercise heart rate was calculated by \nrecording the area under the curve (AUC) response. Internal session load was \nevaluated 30 min after each session. Blood concentrations of creatine kinase and \nlactate dehydrogenase were analyzed before the first visit and 24 h after the \nlast sessions.\nRESULTS: The CWI group presented higher rMSSD than the control group at each \ntime point (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.037). The SD1 was higher in CWI group when \ncompared to the control group following the last exercise session (interaction \nP\u2009=\u20090.038). SD2 was higher in CWI group compared to the control group at each \ntime point (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.030). Both groups presented equal CMJ performance \n(P\u2009>\u20090.05), internal load (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.702; interaction P\u2009=\u20090.062), heart \nrate AUC (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.169; interaction P\u2009=\u20090.663), and creatine kinase \nand lactate dehydrogenase blood concentrations (P\u2009>\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: Repeated post-exercise CWI improves cardiac-autonomic modulation. \nHowever, no differences in neuromuscular performance, muscle damage markers, or \nsession internal load were demonstrated between the groups.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

Following standardized training (5,383 m covered, \n350-m high-speed running, 28 repeated high-intensity efforts, 24 collisions), \nplayers completed a multimodal recovery (REC) strategy (i.e., \u223c640 kcal meal + \n\u223c1,285 kcal snacks or drinks, cold-water immersion, sleep hygiene \nrecommendations) or control (i.e., \u223c640 kcal meal: CONT) practices. Isometric \nmid-thigh pulls (IMTP), countermovement jumps (CMJ), and wellness questionnaires \nwere completed before (-3 hours) and after (+24, +48 hours) training. The \nrecovery strategy influenced IMTP peak force ( p = 0.026), but between-trial \ndifferences were undetectable. No other between-trial effects (all p > 0.05) \nwere seen for IMTP, CMJ, or wellness variables. Training-induced reductions in \nCMJ peak power (-4 \u00b1 6% vs baseline: 4,878 \u00b1 642 W) at +24 hours ( p = 0.016) \ndissipated by +48 hours. Fatigue and lower-body soreness reduced by 16 \u00b1 19% ( p \n= 0.01) and 32 \u00b1 44% ( p = 0.024) at +48 hours versus +24 hours, respectively. \nRelative to CONT (i.e., posttraining nutrition), the effects of a single bout of \nrecovery practices appeared limited when implemented after RL-specific training. \nTherefore, when training included limited collisions, balanced postexercise \nmeals appeared equally effective relative to a multimodal recovery strategy. \nTransient changes in performance and wellness variables after training may have \nimplications for practitioners.

Sea accidents have become an urgent humanitarian crisis due to the high \nnumber of migrants on the move, but data on the physiological effects to sudden \ncool water immersion are not as extensive as cold-water studies. We wanted to \nevaluate to what extent cool water immersion (~18 \u00b0C) may detrimentally affect \ncognitive ability and cardiorespiratory strain compared to the more prevalent \ncold-water (<10-15 \u00b0C) studies.\nMETHODS: In this case, 10 active, healthy men participated in this study which \nconsisted of completing one familiarization trial, and then a control (CON) or \nexperimental (EXP) trial in a randomized, repeated-measures, cross-over fashion, \nseparated by at least 7-days. Cognitive function was assessed via the Symbol \nDigit Modalities Test (SDMT), a code substitution test, performed at baseline, \nthen repeated in either a thermoneutral (~25 \u00b0C room air) dry environment, or \nwhen immersed to the neck in 18 \u00b0C water. Testing consisted of six \"Step\" \ntime-blocks 45-s each, with a 5-s pause between each Step. Cardiorespiratory \nmeasures, continuously recorded, included heart rate (beats per minute), minute \nventilation (V\u02d9E, L\u2219min-1), oxygen consumption (V\u02d9O2, L\u2219min-1), and respiratory \nfrequency (fR, count\u2219min-1).\nRESULTS: Initial responses to cool water (<2 min) found that participants \nperformed ~11% worse on the code substitution test (p = 0.025), consumed 149% \ngreater amounts of oxygen (CI: 5.1 to 9.1 L\u2219min-1, p < 0.0001) and experienced \nhigher cardiovascular strain (HR CI: 13 to 38 beats per minute, p = 0.001) than \nduring the control trial. Physiological strain was in-line to those observed in \nmuch colder water temperature.\nCONCLUSION: Sudden, cool water immersion also negatively affects cognitive \nfunction and cardiorespiratory strain, especially during the first two minutes \nof exposure. The magnitude increase in heart rate is strongly associated with \npoorer cognitive function, even in (relatively) warmer water consistent with \ntemperatures found in the Mediterranean Sea environment.\n\nDOI: 10.3390\/ijerph19031601\nPMCID: PMC8834950\nPMID: 35162622 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors confirm they have no conflict of \ninterests to declare.",

Pain impacts physical activities, joint mobility, \nstress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Cold-water immersion therapy \nreduces inflammation and pain associated with gout arthritis. However, \ncold-water immersion therapy has not been conducted among people worldwide with \ngout arthritis. Objective: To investigate the cold-water immersion intervention \non pain, joint mobility, physical activity, stress, anxiety, depression, and \nquality of life among acute gout patients. Methods: A community-based randomized \ncontrol trial design with two parallel-intervention groups: a cold-water \nimmersion group (20-30\u00b0C 20\u00a0minutes\/day for 4\u00a0weeks) and a control group. In \ntotal, 76 eligible participants in Tomohon City, Indonesia, were recruited using \na multi-stage sampling method and were randomly assigned using block \nrandomization. A generalized estimating equation model was used to analyze the \nresults (coef. \u03b2) and produce 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A path analysis \nwas used to analyze mediating effects. Results: Significant pain alleviation (\u03b2 \n= -2.06; -2.42), improved joint mobility (\u03b2 = 1.20, 1.44), physical activity (\u03b2 \n= 2.05, .59), stress (\u03b2 = -1.25; -1.35), anxiety (\u03b2 = -.62; -1.37), and quality \nof life (\u03b2 = 5.34; 9.93) were detected after cold-water immersion at the \nsecond-week, and were maintained to the fourth-week time point, compared to \npre-intervention and the control group. Depression (\u03b2 = -1.80) had decreased by \nthe fourth week compared to the pre-test and control group. Cold-water immersion \ndirectly mediated alleviation of pain (\u03b2 = -.46, p \u2264 .001) and to promote the \nquality of life (\u03b2 = .16, p = .01). Conclusions: Cold-water immersion decreased \npain, stress, anxiety, and depression, and increased joint mobility, physical \nactivity, and quality of life. It mediated alleviation of pain to increase the \nquality of life.\n\nDOI: 10.1177\/10998004211063547\nPMID: 35021915 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We conducted a randomised cross-over study involving 28 \nhealthy active men where muscle contractile properties of the VM wer recorded \nusing Tensiomyography (TMG) before and after CWI, HWI or passive resting and up \nto one-hour post-application. The main outcomes obtained were muscle \ndisplacement and velocity of deformation according to limb size (Dmr and Vdr). \nOur results showed a significant effect of time (F(3.9,405)\u00a0=32.439; p <0.001; \n\u03b72p\u00a0=0.29) and the interaction between time and temperature (F(7.9,405)\u00a0=5.814; \np <0.001; \u03b72p=0.13) on Dmr but no for temperature alone (F(2,81)\u00a0=2.013; p \n=0.14; \u03b72p=0.04) while for Vdr, both time (F(5.2,486)\u00a0=23.068; p <0.001 \n\u03b72p\u00a0=\u00a00.22) and temperature (F(2,81)\u00a0=4.219; p =\u00a00.018; \u03b72p=\u00a00.09) as well as \nthe interaction (F(10.4,486)\u00a0=7.784; p <0.001; \u03b72p\u00a0=0.16) were found \nsignificant. Compared to CWI, HWI increased Dmr post-application and Vdr both \npost-application as well as 15 and 45' thereafter.

In each trial, \nparticipants completed a 45-min preload exercise (50% V\u0307O2peak), followed by a \n15-min TT. Physiological (rectal [Tre], skin [Tsk], and neck [Tneck] \ntemperature, and heart rate [HR]) and perceptual data (ratings of perceived \nexertion [RPE], thermal comfort [TC] and thermal sensation [TS]) were measured \nthroughout.\nRESULTS: Tre and Tsk were lower in PRE and PRE\u202f+\u202fPER at the start of the preload \n(p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Tre remained lower throughout the preload following CWI although \nthese differences were no longer present at the start of the TT (p\u202f=\u202f0.22). \nTneck was lowered throughout in PER and PRE\u202f+\u202fPER (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). No other \nphysiological or perceptual differences were observed at the start or end of the \npreload or TT. Participants covered a similar TT distance in all trials \n(15.7-15.9\u202fkm, p\u202f=\u202f0.77).\nCONCLUSIONS: Pre-cooling induced thermoregulatory benefits for ~45\u202fmin and \nperceptual benefits for the same duration when supplemented with per-cooling. \nNeck per-cooling offered no such benefits when used in isolation. Neither pre- \nnor per-cooling, in isolation or combination, improved subsequent 15-min cycling \ntime-trial performance in well-trained participants in the heat (40\u202f\u00b0C).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Sports Medicine Australia.

However, several factors such as \nshocking induced by cold water can affect the effectiveness of this technique.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 4 weeks cold water \nhabituation on the effectiveness of CWI recovery technique on muscle damage and \nfunction indices of young soccer players.\nMETHODS: Twenty young men with no previous experience of CWI participated in \nthis study. Output power and RSADec of subjects were measured. The subjects then \nperformed a simulated soccer test and, after collecting blood samples, were \nimmediately immersed in 15 \u00b0 C water for 15 minutes. Twenty-four hours later \nblood sampling and functional tests were repeated. Subjects then were divided \nrandomly into two groups of exercise with CWI recovery and exercise with passive \nrecovery. After four weeks, the blood sampling and performance tests repeated \nlike the pre-test.\nRESULTS: The CWI had no significant effect on serum levels of AST and LDH before \nand after 4 weeks of CWI (P> 0.05). Also, there was no significant difference in \npower output and RSADec after CWI before and after cold water habituation (P> \n0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: It seems that the experience of recovering by immersion in \ncold-water has no effect on the effectiveness of this method. Therefore, soccer \ncoaches and athletes should think more about using this recovery method.\n\nINTRODUCTION : l'immersion en eau froide est l'une des techniques de \nr\u00e9cup\u00e9ration et de r\u00e9\u00e9ducation les plus courantes chez les athl\u00e8tes.

Electronic address: marius.brazaitis@lsu.lt.\n\nA poor outcome of whole-body hypothermia often results from a late complication, \nrather than from acute effects of hypothermia. A low body (cell) temperature or \nthe increase in the concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, \nand norepinephrine in response to acute cold stress have been proposed as potent \nproinflammatory cytokine suppressant. In the current study, we tested the \nhypothesis that the recovery of body temperature from a whole-body intermittent \ncold-water immersion (CWI, at 13-14\u00a0\u00b0C for a total 170\u00a0min) is associated with a \ndelayed response of proinflammatory cytokines in young healthy men. Our results \nrevealed a delay in the increase in the proinflammatory interleukin 6 and \ninterleukin 1\u03b2 cytokines after the CWI, which paralleled the changes in \ncortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and body temperature. CWI decreased tumor \nnecrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) immediately and 1\u00a0h after the CWI. Although TNF-\u03b1 had \nrecovered to the pre-immersion level at 2\u00a0h after CWI, its natural circadian \ncycle kinetics was disrupted until 12\u00a0h after the CWI. Furthermore, we showed \nthat CWI strongly modified the white blood cell counts, with changes reaching a \npeak between 1 and 2\u00a0h after the CWI.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, our aim was to study hematological \nprofiles, systemic inflammation, and muscle damage responses to a specific \npost-race CWI (vs. control) during recovery after the Ironman World \nChampionship, a culmination of \u223c100\u2009000 athletes competing in global qualifying \nIronman events each year. Twenty-nine competitors were randomized into either a \nCWI or control (CON) group. Physiological parameters and blood samples were \ntaken at pre-race, after intervention (POST), and 24 (+1DAY) and 48 hours \n(+2DAY) following the race. Muscle damage markers (plasma myoglobin, serum \ncreatine kinase) were elevated at POST, +1DAY, and +2DAY, while inflammatory \ncytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and total leukocyte counts were \nincreased only at POST. CWI had no effect on these markers. Numbers of the most \nabundant circulating cell type, neutrophils, were elevated at POST more so in \nCWI (p < 0.05, vs. CON). Despite that neutrophil counts may be a sensitive \nmarker to detect subtle effects, CWI does not affect recovery markers 24- and \n48-hours post-race (vs. CON). Overall, we determined that our short CWI protocol \nwas not sufficient to improve recovery. Novelty: Ironman World Championship \nevent increased circulating muscle damage markers, inflammatory markers, and \nhematological parameters, including circulating immune cell sub-populations that \nrecover 24-48 hours after the race. 12-min CWI post-ultraendurance event affects \nthe absolute numbers of neutrophils acutely, post-race (vs. CON), but does not \nimpact recovery 24- and 48-hours post-race.\n\nDOI: 10.1139\/apnm-2020-0602\nPMID: 33507839 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Fifteen subjects completed \nthree testing sessions at 1-week intervals. Each trial consisted of a first WE \nand WAnT, and a 20-min recovery intervention (randomized: CCWI, CWI, and PAS) \nbefore repeating a second WE and WAnT. The WE was measured by the metabolic \ndemand during 50% V.O2max exercise. HR, Tsub, and [La]b were recorded throughout \nthe testing sessions. There was a signi\ufb01cant decline in the WE from 1st bout to \n2nd bout at each recovery intervention. The WAnT was also significantly reduced \nat 2nd bout. Significantly reduced [La]b was achieved at CCWI compared to PAS, \nbut not to the CWI. Likewise, the reduction in HR following immersion was the \nlargest at CCWI compared to the other conditions. These \ufb01ndings indicate that \nCCWI is an effective intervention for maintaining repeated cycling work \nefficiency, which might be associated with reduced [La]b and HR.\n\nDOI: 10.1080\/15438627.2020.1860048\nPMID: 33300394 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Recently, however, indications have emerged suggesting \nthat the regular use of cold-water immersion might be detrimental to strength \ntraining adaptation.\nMETHODS: In a randomized crossover design, 11 participants performed two 8-week \ntraining periods including 3 leg training sessions per week, separated by an \n8-week \"wash out\" period. After each session, participants performed 10 minutes \nof either whole-body cold-water immersion (cooling) or passive sitting \n(control). Leg press 1-repetition maximum and countermovement jump performance \nwere determined before (pre), after (post) and 3 weeks after (follow-up) both \ntraining periods. Before and after training periods, leg circumference and \nmuscle thickness (vastus medialis) were measured.\nRESULTS: No significant effects were found for strength or jump performance. \nComparing training adaptations (pre vs post), small and negligible negative \neffects of cooling were found for 1-repetition maximum (g = 0.42; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.42 to 1.26) and countermovement jump (g = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.82 \nto 0.86). Comparing pre versus follow-up, moderate negative effects of cooling \nwere found for 1-repetition maximum (g = 0.71; 95% CI, -0.30 to 1.72) and \ncountermovement jump (g = 0.64; 95% CI, -0.36 to 1.64). A significant condition \n\u00d7 time effect (P = .01, F = 10.00) and a large negative effect of cooling (g = \n1.20; 95% CI, -0.65 to 1.20) were observed for muscle thickness.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present investigation suggests small negative effects of \nregular cooling on strength training adaptations.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2019-0965\nPMID: 33217726 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Seventy-eight older men and \nwomen performed a single bout of strength training on the calf muscles (3 \nexercises with 4 sets of 10 reps with 75% of 1RM) to induce muscle damage. After \nthe damaging exercise, participants received either a 15-minute massage on calf \nmuscles, or a CWI of the lower limb in cold water (15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00b0C) for 15\u00a0minute, or \npassive rest. Interventions were applied immediately after the exercise protocol \nand at 24, 48, and 72\u00a0hours post-exercise. Muscle pain, calf muscle strength, \njoint position sense, dynamic balance, postural sway, and fear of falling were \nmeasured at each time point. Repeated application of massage after EIMD relieved \nmuscle pain, attenuated the loss of muscle strength and joint position senses, \nreduce balance impairments, and fear of falling in older adults (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.05). \nHowever, repeated applications of CWI, despite relieving muscle pain (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.05), \ndid not attenuate the loss of muscle strength, joint position senses, balance \nimpairments, and fear of falling. CWI had only some modest effects on muscle \npain, but massage attenuated EIMD symptoms and the related impairments in muscle \nstrength, joint position sense, balance, and postural sway in untrained older \nindividuals. Therefore, older exercisers who plan to participate in strength \ntraining can benefit from massage for recovery from muscle damage indices and \nbalance to decrease falling risk during the days following strength training.\n\n\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons A\/S.

The aim of this study is to compare the \nimpacts of two methods of immersion of legs in cold and warm water on the RLS \nsymptoms among the pregnant women.\nMETHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 80 pregnant women with \nRLS who referred to Taleghani educational-therapy center. After obtaining their \ninformed consent, they were selected by accessible method and randomly allocated \ninto group 1 (warm water) and group 2 (cold water). Group 1 were asked to put \ntheir legs in cold water for 10\u2009min every night for 2 weeks. The group 2 put \ntheir legs in warm water under the same condition. The severity of RLS was \nmeasured before and after the study. Data analysis was conducted using \ndescriptive as well as the analytical statistics such as Chi-square, independent \nT test, pair T test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon and covariance.\nRESULTS: After intervention, mean RLS of the cold water group was11.02\u2009\u00b1\u20094.93; \nwhile this mean was 13.50\u2009\u00b1\u20094.74 in the warm water group. The difference between \nthe two groups was significant (p\u2009=\u20090.017). Results also revealed that the \nseverity of RLS symptoms at the end of the treatment was different from the \nbeginning of the research in both groups (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The intervention with both \nwarm and cold water declined the RLS symptoms among pregnant women.\nCONCLUSION: The warm and cold water can be used for this purpose depending on \nthe women's preference. However, this article recommends the cold water for more \nreducing of symptoms.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 149-155, 2022-This study \ncompares the effects of 2 common recovery interventions performed shortly after \nan exhausting interval running session on running economy (RE) and biomechanics. \nForty-eight well-trained male runners performed an exhaustive interval running \nprotocol and an incremental treadmill test 24 hours later at 3 speeds: 12, 14, \nand 16 km\u00b7h-1. Subjects randomly received either massage, cold water immersion \n(CWI), or passive rest (control). Runners repeated the treadmill test 48 hours \nafter the first test. A two-way mixed analysis of variance was performed \ncomparing groups and testing times. The massage group had significantly better \nrecovery than the control group at 14 km\u00b7h-1 in RE (p < 0.05; \u03b72 = 0.176) and \ngreater stride height and angle changes at 16 km\u00b7h-1 (p < 0.05; \u03b72 = 0.166 and p \n< 0.05; \u03b72 = 0.208, respectively). No differences were observed between the CWI \nand control groups. The massage group had greater stride height and angle \nchanges at 16 km\u00b7h-1 than the CWI group (p < 0.05; \u03b72 = 0.139 and p < 0.05; \u03b72 = \n0.168, respectively). Moreover, differences in magnitude suggested moderate \neffects on RE (\u03b72 = 0.076) and swing time (\u03b72 = 0.110). These results suggest \nthat massage intervention promotes faster recovery of RE and running \nbiomechanics than CWI or passive rest.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 National Strength and Conditioning Association.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000003395\nPMID: 31800477 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Training and match performance were assessed \nusing a GPS-tracking system and perceived exertion (RPE). Daily ratings of \ndelayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), perceived stress and recovery, quality of \nsleep, heart-rate recovery and serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate \ndehydrogenase, and urea nitrogen were also recorded. Repeated-sprint ability \n(RSA) and counter-movement jump (CMJ) were carried out on days 1 and 5.\nRESULTS: There was no significance between intervention differences in time-on \npitch, total distance, velocity zones, and accelerometer-base parameters during \nmatch performance (all p\u2009>\u20090.05). DOMS (p\u2009<\u20090.01), RPE (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and CK \n(p\u2009<\u20090.01) were significantly elevated over the course of the tournament; \nhowever, no between-intervention effects were observed (all p\u2009>\u20090.05).

There are several interventions available for exercise induced \nmuscle damage recovery, but cold-water immersion (CWI) stands out among them. \nThe effects of CWI are unclear in the literature and, although the number of \nstreet runners has been growing, there is a gap in the scientific evidence \nregarding the use of CWI to recover runners' performance after a 10-km street \nrun. Purpose: The goal of our study was to analyze the effects of CWI on the \nrecovery of muscle damage markers after a 10-km street run. Method: We randomly \nassigned thirty male recreational street runners, immediately after a 10-km \nstreet run, into three recovery groups: control (rest for 10 minutes), immersion \n(10 min immersed in water without ice at room temperature) and CWI (10 min \nimmersed in water with ice at 10\u00baC). We assessed pain, triple hop distance, \nextensor peak torque and blood creatine kinase levels pre- and post-run, \npost-intervention and 24 hours after the run. Results: The 10-km run was enough \nto decrease triple hop distance and extensor peak torque, and increase levels of \ncreatine kinase (p < 0.05); however, we found no time\/group interactions in any \nof the assessed variables after we applied the appropriate interventions (p > \n0.05). Conclusion: 10-min CWI at 10\u00b0C was no more effective than water immersion \nand rest in recovering muscle damage markers after 10-km runs.\n\nDOI: 10.1080\/02701367.2019.1659477\nPMID: 31652109 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Nine healthy \nmale subjects (age, 21 \u00b1 1 year) performed 45 minutes of cycling in a hot \nenvironment (35\u00b0 C, 40-60% relative humidity) at 65% of peak oxygen uptake. \nThereafter, subjects underwent the CWS condition (15 minutes, 15\u00b0 C water \nshower) or control (SIT25; 15 minutes passive recovery in 25\u00b0 C room) in a \nrandomized crossover design. After each 15 minutes, subjects sat in a 25\u00b0 C room \nfor another 2-hour recovery. Heart rate, Tc, and TCS were recorded before and \nimmediately after exercise, immediately after CWS or SIT25, and at 30 minutes, \n1, and 2 hours during additional recovery. Salivary cortisol was collected at \nthe same time points except at 30 minutes of the additional recovery period. \nThermal comfort sensation was higher immediately after CWS (+4; very \ncomfortable) than SIT25 (+1; just comfortable). The change of HR decreased \nfaster with CWS (-18.3 \u00b1 2.3%) than with SIT25 (-7.0 \u00b1 4.6%) at the first \n30-minute recovery time point (p < 0.01). No differences between recovery \nconditions were observed for the Tc or salivary cortisol at any time point \nduring the 2-hour recovery period. The findings demonstrate that a 15-minute, \n15\u00b0 C CWS was not effective in reducing Tc or salivary cortisol during recovery \nfrom exercise in a hot environment. However, CWS can promote TCS by facilitating \na faster HR recovery after 30-minute postintervention compared with passive \nrecovery. The cooling benefits of a CWS could be only recommended to reduce \ncardiac stress after routine workout in a hot environment.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000003017\nPMID: 31343603 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, \nrecent reports have cautioned that CWI may attenuate the adaptive response to \nresistance training.\nPURPOSE: To determine the effect of post resistance-exercise CWI on circulating \nfree testosterone (T) and cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) response.\nMETHODS: Using a randomized and counterbalanced repeated-measures design, 11 \nresistance-trained men completed two workouts (6 sets of 10 repetitions of back \nsquats at 80% of maximum load) a week apart after which they took part in either \n15\u00a0min of CWI (15\u00a0\u00b0C) or passive recovery. T, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 were measured in \nblood samples taken before (PRE) and 5 (5POST), 15 (15POST), 30 (30POST), and 60 \n(60POST) min post-exercise and compared between treatments and over time.\nRESULTS: For T, a significant interaction effect of condition over time \n(p\u2009=\u20090.030) as well as greater relative concentrations of T in CON (\u03949.2%) than \nCWI (\u0394-0.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.049) at 30POST were observed. In addition, at 60POST, T \ndropped below PRE values in CWI (\u0394-10.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.028) but not in CON (\u0394-1.6%, \np\u2009=\u20090.850). A suppressed cytokine response was observed after CWI in IL-6 at \n30POST (CWI: \u03944.9%, CON: \u039447.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.041) and TNF\u03b1 at 15POST (CWI: \u03945.3%, CON: \n\u039417.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.022).\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI blunted the T and cytokine response after a bout of resistance \nexercise. These results indicate that CWI results in an altered anabolic \nresponse and may help to explain the previous observation of attenuated \nhypertrophy when CWI is used after resistance exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-019-04178-7\nPMID: 31222379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Each \nparticipant performed a maximum-exertion exercise performance test on a bicycle, \nand heart rate was measured. Subsequently, six cycles of HIIE (1 minute at 120% \nheart rate reserve [HRR] and 4 minutes at 40% HRR) were performed in a random \nsequence, and the recovery period involved either CWI or static rest (SR).\nRESULTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels at the 6th and 20th minute \nof CWI recovery were significantly higher than those during SR and significantly \nhigher than those during a quiet state at the 6th minute. The heart rates at the \n20th minute and 35th minute of CWI recovery were significantly lower than that \nduring SR, and the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) at the 6th and 20th \nminute of CWI recovery were significantly lower than that during SR. No \nsignificant difference in lactate production was evident between the two \nrecovery strategies. Ear temperature was not significantly different when it was \nquiet, at the end of exercise, and at the 6th and 35th minute of recovery; \nhowever, at the 20th minute of recovery, ear temperature during CWI was \nsignificantly higher than that during SR.\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI after HIIE reduced the extent to which blood pressure \ndecreased. For the fatigue-related heart rate and RPE indicators, CWI was \nsuperior to SR.\n\nDOI: 10.23736\/S0022-4707.19.09771-8\nPMID: 31219254 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In a randomized repeated-measures design, nine \nrecreationally active males completed an acute two-legged high-intensity cycling \nprotocol (8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min at 82.5% peak power output) followed by 10\u00a0min of two-legged \npost-exercise CWI (8\u00b0C) or control conditions (CON). During each trial, one limb \ncommenced exercise with low (LOW: <300\u00a0mmol\u00b7kg-1 dw) or very low (VLOW: \n<150\u00a0mmol\u00b7kg-1 dw) pre-exercise glycogen concentration, achieved via completion \nof a one-legged glycogen depletion protocol undertaken the evening prior. \nExercise increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA at 3\u00a0h post-exercise. Very low muscle \nglycogen attenuated the increase in PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression compared with the LOW \nlimbs in both the control (CON VLOW ~3.6-fold vs. CON LOW ~5.6-fold: P\u00a0=\u00a00.023, \nES 1.22 Large) and CWI conditions (CWI VLOW ~2.4-fold vs. CWI LOW ~8.0 fold: \nP\u00a0=\u00a00.019, ES 1.43 Large). Furthermore, PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression in the CWI-LOW \ntrial was not significantly different to the CON LOW limb (P\u00a0=\u00a00.281, ES 0.67 \nModerate). Data demonstrate that the previously reported effects of \npost-exercise CWI on PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression (as regulated systemically via \n\u03b2-adrenergic mediated cell signaling) are offset in those conditions in which \nlocal stressors (i.e., high-intensity exercise and low muscle glycogen \navailability) have already sufficiently activated the AMPK-PGC-1\u03b1 signaling \naxis.

Total urine output during submersion was not different between \ngroups (1.69 \u00b1 0.49 (NR), 1.75 \u00b1 0.52 (RH) L; P = 0.74) eliciting a body mass \nreduction of -2.2 \u00b1 0.3 and -0.8 \u00b1; 0.3% (P \u27e8 0.01), respectively. Run duration \nwas not different (547 \u00b1 141 (NR), 566 \u00b1 152 (RH) s; P = 0.79); however, both NR \nand RH run duration was shorter compared to CON (722 \u00b1 170 s; P = 0.04). \nCumulative stress index was suppressed in NR (534 \u00b1 163 mmHg*min) and RH (591 \u00b1 \n129 mmHg*min) compared to CON (707 \u00b1 170 mmHg*min, P V#8804; 0.03), with no \ndifferences between submersion trials (P = 0.23).\nCONCLUSION: Compared to a non-submersed state, run duration and orthostatic \ntolerance was reduced following a four-hour cold-water submersion.

Therefore, \nthe aim of this study was to compare the effects between cold-water immersion \n(CWI) conduction and partial-body cryotherapy (PBC) convection on perfusion of \nthe microcirculation and skin temperature on the thigh.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy males were randomly allocated to CWI (10\u00b0C \nfor 10\u00a0minutes) or PBC (-60\u00b0C for 30\u00a0seconds, -135\u00b0C for 2\u00a0minutes). Perfusion \nand skin temperature measurements were conducted on the anterior thigh region up \nto 60\u00a0minutes post-treatment.\nRESULTS: Cold-water immersion decreased perfusion of the microcirculation \nsignificantly compared to baseline values between 10\u00a0minutes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and \n30\u00a0minutes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) post-treatment. PBC increased perfusion of the \nmicrocirculation and decreased skin temperature only at the first measurement \ninterval (0\u00a0minute, both P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) post-treatment. Additionally, local skin \ntemperature was significantly decreased compared to baseline values only after \nCWI up to 30\u00a0minutes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) post-treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Cold-water immersion reduced local skin microcirculation and skin \ntemperature while PBC only slightly increased the perfusion of the \nmicrocirculation immediately after the treatment. For cooling purposes, the \nconduction method seems superior compared to the convection method, assessed \nwith a LSCI device.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

A new mathematical approach to explore the \npost-exercise recovery process and its applicability in a cold water immersion \nprotocol. J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1266-1275, 2019-The objective of this study \nwas to propose a mathematical model to analyze the post-training recovery of \nperceptive, functional, metabolic, and autonomic parameters from the use of cold \nwater immersion (CWI) through isolated and combined analysis. Following \nsimulated training, 64 male soccer players were randomized into an experimental \ngroup (EG: CWI, 13 \u00b1 1\u00b0 C; 15 minutes) and a control group (CG: passive \nrecovery; 15 minutes). Perceptive (soreness and perception of recovery), \nautonomic (heart rate variability [HRV]), metabolic (lactate concentration), and \nfunctional parameters (squat jump, T agility test, sprint test, 40-second test, \nand maximal voluntary isometric contraction) were analyzed before and at \nspecific moments after training (without exceeding 2 hours after training). The \nvariables were analyzed using the raw data, dichotomization of each variable \n(isolated analysis), and through a mathematical model using the combination of \nall parameters analyzed (combined analysis). The combined analysis did not \ndemonstrate better efficacy of the EG compared with the CG (69.17 and 63.4%, p = \n0.09). In the isolated analysis, a chance of the technique being better was \nobserved in the metabolic parameter at 1 and 2 hours after training (odds ratio, \n95% confidence interval = 3.75 [1.01-13.88] and 11.11 [1.25-98.49]), \nrespectively, and in the autonomic parameter at 40-45 minutes after training \n(4.4 [1.09-17.67]). For the raw data, all parameters analyzed presented recovery \nby 2 hours after training for both groups. Based on the proposed mathematical \nmodel, it is concluded that CWI is not better than the control condition. \nHowever, considering the analysis of variables in isolation, the technique \npresents a better chance of recovery for blood lactate concentration and HRV.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000003041\nPMID: 30882563 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In a randomized design, eight soccer players completed the Loughborough \nIntermittent Shuttle Test followed by 10\u202fmin of either CWI (10C\u00b0) or \nthermoneutral water immersion (TWI) (28C\u00b0). Physical performance (Squat jump: \nSJ, countermovement jump: CMJ, maximal voluntary contraction: MVC, and 20\u202fm \nsprint: SP), muscle damage parameter (creatine kinase: CK) and perceived muscle \nsoreness were assessed at baseline, 0\u202fh, 24\u202fh, 48\u202fh and 72\u202fh after the \nintermittent test. After the test, a decrease was observed in SJ and in CMJ at \n0\u202fh, 24\u202fh, 48\u202fh and 72\u202fh with TWI (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and only at 0\u202fh for SJ with CWI \n(p\u202f<\u202f0.05). SP decreased at 24\u202fh and 48\u202fh after the test with TWI (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and \nonly at 24\u202fh with CWI (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). MVC, CK activity and perceived muscle soreness \nincreased in both condition after the test and returned to baseline levels 72\u202fh \nafter the test with TWI (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and at 48\u202fh with CWI (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). For the \ncorrelation between physical performance and muscle damage parameters in CWI \nsession, the statistical analysis didn't reveal any significant link between CK \nand SJ, CMJ, MVC or SP values (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). The results suggest that CWI \nimmediately after an intermittent test reduces muscle damage and perceived \nmuscle soreness, and accelerate recovery of physical performance in professional \nsoccer players.

Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived \nrecovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), \nimmediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race \n(post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of \nfatigue were determined at pre and post24.\nRESULTS: Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the \nchanges between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery \n(ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine \nkinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), \nwith MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) \nand improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI \nand MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = \n1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = \n0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).\nCONCLUSIONS: In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue \nsymptoms lasting at least 24h. To restore subjective fatigue measures, the \nauthors recommend CWI and MAS, as these recovery strategies are more effective \nthan PAS, with ACT being even disadvantageous.

Eight CWI sessions (one per week), until the hip in a standing \nposition (10 min; temperature: 11-12 \u00b0C) were performed.\nRESULTS: The two groups were age-, height- and weight matched. Comparatively to \nthe race time of \u00abperiod1\u00bb, this of \u00abperiod2\u00bb was decreased in the CWI group \n(3.21\u00b10.04 vs. 3.15\u00b10.04 min) and was increased in the no-CWI group (3.23\u00b10.05 \nvs. 3.27\u00b10.07 min). Comparatively to the HRs (before, after the race) of \n\u00abperiod1\u00bb, these of \u00abperiod2\u00bb were decreased in the CWI group (36\u00b11 vs. 34\u00b11%; \n56\u00b13 vs. 44\u00b12%) and were increased in the no-CWI group (35\u00b12 vs. 36\u00b11%; 55\u00b12 vs. \n57\u00b12%). Comparatively to the after race Oxy-sat' of the \u00abperiod1\u00bb, this of \n\u00abperiod2\u00bb was increased in the CWI group (96\u00b11 vs. 98\u00b10%) and was decreased in \nthe no-CWI group (96\u00b11 vs. 95\u00b11%). While in the CWI group, the percent of \ndesaturators was decreased between \u00abperiod1\u00bb and \u00abperiod2\u00bb (30 vs. 0%), in the \nno-CWI group, percentages remained similar (50 vs. 90%).\nCONCLUSION: CWI improves aerobic capacity and muscle strength of young \nfootballers.\n\nPMID: 30324975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-two professional male rugby players were randomized into \nCWI (10 \u00b0C\/10 min; n = 11) or control (CON: 30 min seated; n = 11) groups. \nActivity profile from Global Positioning Satellite systems and postmatch rating \nof perceived exertion were measured to determined match load. Biochemical (tumor \nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6), neuromuscular performance (squat \n(SJ) and countermovement jumps (CMJ), peak power output (PPO), rate of force \ndevelopment (RFD), stiffness, 10- and 30-m sprint time, and perceptual markers \n(soreness, perceived recovery) were obtained before and immediately after the \nmatch, and then at 30 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the match. Magnitude-based \ninference and Cohen's effect size (ES) were used to analyze change over time and \nbetween groups. Thus, the higher\/beneficial, similar\/trivial, or lower\/harmful \ndifferences were evaluated as follows: <1%, almost certainly not; 1% to 5%, very \nunlikely; 5% to 25%, unlikely; 25% to 75%, possible; 75% to 95%, likely; 95% to \n99%, very likely; >99%, almost certainly. Changes were unclear for the match \nloads, sprint times, and perceptual markers between groups. Higher %\u0394SJ at 24 h \n(very likely (ES = 0.75)) and in %\u0394PPO_SJ at 48 h (likely (ES = 0.51)) were \nobserved in CWI than in CON. Values in %\u0394RDF_CMJ were higher immediately after \n(likely (ES = 0.83)), 30 min after (very likely (ES = 0.97)), and 24 h after the \nmatch (likely (ES = 0.93)) in CWI than in CON. Furthermore, %\u0394log TNF-\u03b1 were \nlower in the CWI group than in the CON group immediately after (almost certainly \n(ES = -0.76)), 24 h after (very likely (ES = -1.09)), and 72 h after the match \n(likely (ES = -0.51)), and in \u0394stiffness_SJ at 30 min after (likely (ES = \n-0.67)) and 48 h after the match (very likely (ES = -0.97)). Also, different \nwithin-groups effects throughout postmatch were reported. Implementing postmatch \nCWI-based strategies improved the recovery of markers of inflammation and \nfatigue in rugby players, despite no change in markers of speed or perceptual \nrecovery.\n\nDOI: 10.1139\/apnm-2018-0542\nPMID: 30321486 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The aim of this study was to investigate \nthe effects of CWI during an intense 3-wk preseason phase in elite rugby \nathletes.\nMETHODS: A total of 23 elite male rugby union athletes were randomized to either \nCWI (10\u00a0min at 10\u00b0C, n\u2009=\u200910) or a passive recovery control (CON, n\u2009=\u200913) during \n3 wk of high-volume training. Athletes were exposed to either CWI or CON after \neach training day (12 d in total). Running loads, conditioning, and gym sessions \nwere kept the same between groups. Measures of countermovement jump, perceived \nmuscle soreness, and wellness were obtained twice a week, and saliva samples for \ndetermining cortisol and interleukin-6 were collected once per week.\nRESULTS: Although no significant differences were observed between CWI and CON \nfor any measure, CWI resulted in lower fatigue markers throughout the study as \ndemonstrated by the moderate effects on muscle soreness (d\u2009=\u20090.58-0.91) and \ninterleukin-6 (d\u2009=\u2009-0.83) and the small effects (d\u2009=\u20090.23-0.38) on \ncountermovement jump in comparison with CON.\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI may provide some beneficial effect by reducing fatigue and \nsoreness during an intense 3-wk training phase in elite rugby athletes.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2018-0313\nPMID: 29952675 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The purpose of this paper is to determine the influence of CWI \nimmediately following an Ironman triathlon on markers of muscle damage, \ninflammation and muscle soreness.\nDESIGN: Prospective cohort study.\nMETHODS: Thirty three (22 male, 11 female), triathletes participating in the \nIronman World Championships volunteered to participate (mean\u00b1SD: age=40\u00b111years; \nheight=174.5\u00b19.1cm; body mass=70\u00b111.8kg; percent body fat=11.4\u00b14.1%, finish \ntime=11:03.00\u00b101:25.08). Post race, participants were randomly assigned to a \n10-min bout of 10\u00b0C CWI or no-intervention control group. Data collection \noccurred pre-intervention (PRE), post-intervention (POST), 16h (16POST) and 40h \n(40POST) following the race. Linear mixed model ANOVA with Bonferroni \ncorrections were performed to examine group by time differences for delayed \nonset muscle soreness (DOMS), hydration indices, myoglobin, creatine kinase \n(CK), cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and percent body mass loss \n(%BML). Pearson's bivariate correlations were used for comparisons with \nfinishing time. Alpha level was set a priori at 0.05.\nRESULTS: No significant group by time interactions occurred. Significant \ndifferences occurred for POST BML (-1.7\u00b10.9kg) vs. 16POST, and 40POST BML \n(0.9\u00b11.4, -0.1\u00b11.2kg, respectively; p<0.001). Compared to PRE, myoglobin, CRP \nand CK remained significantly elevated at 40POST. Cortisol returned to PRE \nvalues by 16POST and IL-6 returned to PRE values by 40POST.\nCONCLUSION: A single bout of CWI did not provide any physiological benefit \nduring recovery from a triathlon within 40h post race. Effect of CWI beyond this \ntime is unknown.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Perceived thermal sensation (TS) and comfort were measured \nimmediately after T1 and T2. Power output was significantly improved in T2 \ncompared with T1 in the CMWI condition (+15.6%). Performance did not change in \nthe CWI condition. After immersion, Trec was lower in CWI (-1.17 \u00b0C) than in \nCMWI (-0.6 \u00b0C). TS decreased significantly after immersion in both conditions. \nThis decline was significantly more pronounced in CMWI (5.9 \u00b1 1 to 3.6 \u00b1 0.5) \nthan in CWI (5.6 \u00b1 0.9 to 4.4 \u00b1 1.2). In CMWI, RPE was significantly higher in \nT1 (6.57 \u00b1 0.9) than in T2 (5.14 \u00b1 1.25). However, there was no difference in \nTC. This study suggests that menthol immersion probably (i) improves the \nperformance of a repeated 20-min cycling bout, (ii) decreases TS, and (iii) \nimpairs thermoregulation processes.\n\nDOI: 10.1139\/apnm-2017-0525\nPMID: 29533726 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of whole \nbody cryotherapy (WBC) and cold water immersion (CWI) on markers of recovery \nfollowing a marathon.\nMETHODS: Thirty-one endurance trained males completed a marathon. Participants \nwere randomly assigned to a CWI, WBC or placebo group. Perceptions of muscle \nsoreness, training stress and markers of muscle function were recorded before \nthe marathon and at 24 and 48\u00a0h post exercise. Blood samples were taken at \nbaseline, post intervention and 24 and 48\u00a0h post intervention to assess \ninflammation and muscle damage.\nRESULTS: WBC had a harmful effect on muscle function compared to CWI post \nmarathon. WBC positively influenced perceptions of training stress compared to \nCWI. With the exception of C-reactive protein (CRP) at 24 and 48\u00a0h, neither \ncryotherapy intervention positively influenced blood borne markers of \ninflammation or structural damage compared to placebo.\nCONCLUSION: The findings show WBC has a negative impact on muscle function, \nperceptions of soreness and a number of blood parameters compared to CWI, \ncontradicting the suggestion that WBC may be a superior recovery strategy. \nFurther, cryotherapy is no more effective than a placebo intervention at \nimproving functional recovery or perceptions of training stress following a \nmarathon. These findings lend further evidence to suggest that treatment belief \nand the placebo effect may be largely responsible for the beneficial effects of \ncryotherapy on recovery following a marathon.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-017-3757-z\nPMID: 29127510 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

J Strength Cond Res 32(3): 756-763, \n2018-Cold-water immersion (CWI) is commonly applied to speed up the recovery \nprocess after exercise. Muscle damage may induce a performance reduction and \nconsequence of the intramuscular pressure induced by the muscular swelling. The \naim of the study was to verify the CWI effects on muscle thickness (MT) behavior \nof the elbow flexors after a strength training (ST) protocol. Eleven men were \nsubmitted to an ST, performed in 2 different weeks. In one of the weeks, \nsubjects experienced a passive recovery. In the other, subjects were submitted \nto a CWI (20 minutes at 5-10\u00b0 C). Ultrasound (US) images were taken before, \nafter, as well as 24, 48, and 72 hours after exercise, to evaluate the MT. \nMuscle thickness in both exercise arm (EA) and control arm (CA) was \nsignificantly higher 48 and 72 hours after exercise when subjects were submitted \nto a passive recovery compared with the CWI (p = 0.029, p = 0.028, p = 0.009, \nand p = 0.001, 48 hours, 72 hours, EA, and CA, respectively). When each arm was \nanalyzed with or without using CWI individually, significantly higher MT was \nobserved in the EA with CWI: before exercise in relation to 72 hours after \nexercise (p = 0.042) and after exercise in relation to the other measurements (p \n= 0.003, p = 0.003, p = 0.038, and p < 0.0001, before exercise and 24, 48, 72 \nhours after exercise, respectively). The evaluation of MT by US provides \nevidence that CWI after ST (and 24 hours after exercise) may reduce muscle \nswelling in the postexercise days when compared with a passive recovery.

We used painful cutaneous \nelectrical stimulation (PCES) to induce TS in a novel CPM-model. Additionally, \nto evaluate a more objective parameter, we recorded the corresponding changes of \ncortical evoked potentials (PCES-EP).\nMETHODS: We examined the CPM-effect in 17 healthy subjects in a randomized \ncontrolled cross-over design during immersion of the non-dominant hand into \n10\u00a0\u00b0C or 24\u00a0\u00b0C cold water (CS). Using three custom-built concentric surface \nelectrodes, electrical stimuli were applied on the dominant hand, inducing pain \nof 40-60 on NRS 0-100 (TS). At baseline, during and after CS we assessed the \nelectrically induced pain intensity and electrically evoked potentials recorded \nover the central electrode (Cz).\nRESULTS: Only in the 10\u00a0\u00b0C-condition, both pain (52.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4 (baseline) vs. \n30.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5 (during CS)) and amplitudes of PCES-EP (42.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4\u00a0\u03bcV (baseline) \nvs. 28.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5\u00a0\u03bcV (during CS)) attenuated during CS and recovered there after \n(all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the 10\u00a0\u00b0C-condition changes of subjective pain ratings \nduring electrical stimulation and amplitudes of PCES-EP correlated significantly \nwith each other (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5) and with CS pain intensity (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5).\nCONCLUSIONS: PCES-EPs are a quantitative measure of pain relief, as changes in \nthe electrophysiological response are paralleled by a consistent decrease in \nsubjective pain ratings. This novel CPM paradigm is a feasible method, which \ncould help to evaluate the function of the endogenous pain modulation processes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS-ID: DRKS00012779 , \nretrospectively registered on 24 July 2017.\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/s12883-017-0946-7\nPMCID: PMC5575837\nPMID: 28851323 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: The \nstudy protocol was in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of \nHelsinki and approved by the local ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, \nRuhr-University Bochum, Germany (Reg.

After a single SIT session, phosphorylated (p-)AMPK, p-p38 MAPK, \np-p53, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) \nmRNA were all increased (P < 0.05). Postexercise CWI had no effect on these \nresponses. Consistent with the lack of a response after a single session, \nregular postexercise CWI had no effect on PGC-1\u03b1 or p53 protein content. Six \nweeks of SIT increased peak aerobic power, maximal oxygen consumption, maximal \nuncoupled respiration (complexes I and II), and 2-km time trial performance (P < \n0.05). However, regular CWI had no effect on changes in these markers, \nconsistent with the lack of response in the markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. \nAlthough these observations suggest that CWI is not detrimental to endurance \nadaptations following 6 wk of SIT, they question whether postexercise CWI is an \neffective strategy to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improvements in \nendurance performance.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 the American Physiological Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/ajpregu.00434.2016\nPMID: 28679683 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The participants in each \ngroup underwent the same fatigue protocol followed by their allocated recovery \nintervention, which lasted for 1 minute. Measurements were taken before and \nafter the fatigue-recovery intervention. The primary outcomes were the sensory \norganization test (SOT) composite equilibrium score (ES) and the \ncondition-specific ES, which were measured using a computerized dynamic \nposturography machine. The secondary outcome was the knee joint repositioning \nerror. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the \neffect of water immersion on each outcome variable.\nRESULTS: There were no significant within- and between-group differences in the \nSOT composite ESs or the condition-specific ESs. However, there was a \ngroup-by-time interaction effect on the knee joint repositioning error. It seems \nthat participants in the RWI group had lower errors over time, but those in the \nIWI and control groups had increased errors over time. The RWI group had \nsignificantly lower error score than the IWI group at postintervention.\nCONCLUSION: One minute of postexercise IWI or RWI did not impair rugby players' \nsensory organization of balance control.

Rectal and thigh skin, deep, and superficial muscle \ntemperatures, thigh, and calf skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry), \nsuperficial femoral artery blood flow (duplex ultrasound), and arterial blood \npressure were measured before, and for 40 min post, cooling interventions.\nRESULTS: Greater reductions in thigh skin (CWI, -5.9\u00b0C \u00b1 1.8\u00b0C; WBC, 0.2\u00b0C \u00b1 \n0.5\u00b0C; P < 0.001) and superficial (CWI, -4.4\u00b0C \u00b1 1.3\u00b0C; WBC, -1.8\u00b0C \u00b1 1.1\u00b0C; P < \n0.001) and deep (CWI, -2.9\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C; WBC, -1.3\u00b0C \u00b1 0.6\u00b0C; P < 0.001) muscle \ntemperatures occurred immediately after CWI. Decreases in femoral artery \nconductance were greater after CWI (CWI, -84% \u00b1 11%; WBC, -59% \u00b1 21%, P < 0.02) \nand thigh (CWI, -80% \u00b1 5%; WBC, -59% \u00b1 14%, P < 0.001), and calf (CWI, -73% \u00b1 \n13%; WBC, -45% \u00b1 17%, P < 0.001) cutaneous vasoconstriction was greater after \nCWI. Reductions in rectal temperature were similar between conditions after \ncooling (CWI, -0.6\u00b0C \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C; WBC, -0.6\u00b0C \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C; P = 0.98).\nCONCLUSION: Greater reductions in blood flow and tissue temperature were \nobserved after CWI in comparison with WBC. These novel findings have practical \nand clinical implications for the use of cooling in the recovery from exercise \nand injury.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0000000000001223\nPMID: 28141620 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Therefore \nit is important to study the issue of dose response in a specific stress model. \nThus the objective was to analyze and compare the effects of CWI during intense \npost-exercise recovery using different durations and temperatures of immersion.\nMETHODS: One hundred and five male individuals were divided into five groups: \none control group (CG) and four recovery groups (G1: 5' at 9\u00b11 \u00b0C; G2: 5' at \n14\u00b11 \u00b0C; G3: 15' at 9\u00b11 \u00b0C; G4: 15' at 14\u00b11 \u00b0C). The volunteers were submitted \nto an exhaustion protocol that consisted of a jump program and the Wingate Test. \nImmediately after the exhaustion protocol, the volunteers were directed to a \ntank with water and ice, where they were immersed for the recovery procedure, \nduring which blood samples were collected for later lactate and creatine kinase \n(CK) analysis. Variables were collected prior to the exercise and 24, 48, 72, \nand 96 hours after its completion.\nRESULTS: For the CK concentration, 15 minutes at 14 \u00b0C was the best intervention \noption, considering the values at 72 hours after exercise, while for the moment \nof peak lactate an advantage was observed for immersion for 5 minutes at 14 \u00b0C. \nRegarding the perception of recovery, CWI for 5 minutes at 14 \u00b0C performed \nbetter long-term, from the time of the intervention to 96 hours post-exercise. \nFor pain, no form of immersion responded better than the CG at the immediately \npost-intervention moment.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in behavior between the CWI intervention \ngroups for the outcomes studied.\n\nDOI: 10.23736\/S0022-4707.17.06841-4\nPMID: 28116880 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Rectal and \nthigh skin temperature, muscle temperature, thigh and calf skin blood flow and \nsuperficial femoral artery blood flow were measured before and after immersion. \nIndices of vascular conductance were calculated (flux and blood flow\/mean \narterial pressure). The colder water reduced thigh skin temperature and deep \nmuscle temperature to the greatest extent (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Reductions in rectal \ntemperature were similar (0.2-0.4\u00b0C) in all three trials (P\u2009=\u2009.69). Femoral \nartery conductance was similar after immersion in both cooling conditions, with \nboth conditions significantly lower (55%) than the control post-immersion \n(P\u2009<\u2009.01).

However, remote locations or monetary or spatial \nrestrictions can challenge the feasibility of CWI. Thus, the development of a \nmodified, portable CWI method would allow for optimal treatment of exertional \nheat stroke in the presence of these challenges.\nOBJECTIVE: \u2003To determine the cooling rate of modified CWI (tarp-assisted cooling \nwith oscillation [TACO]) after exertional hyperthermia.\nDESIGN: \u2003Randomized, crossover controlled trial.\nSETTING: \u2003Environmental chamber (temperature = 33.4\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C, relative humidity \n= 55.7% \u00b1 1.9%).\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: \u2003Sixteen volunteers (9 men, 7 women; age = 26 \u00b1 \n4.7 years, height = 1.76 \u00b1 0.09 m, mass = 72.5 \u00b1 9.0 kg, body fat = 20.7% \u00b1 \n7.1%) with no history of compromised thermoregulation.\nINTERVENTION(S): \u2003Participants completed volitional exercise (cycling or \ntreadmill) until they demonstrated a rectal temperature (Tre) \u226539.0\u00b0C. After \nexercise, participants transitioned to a semirecumbent position on a tarp until \neither Tre reached 38.1\u00b0C or 15 minutes had elapsed during the control (no \nimmersion [CON]) or TACO (immersion in 151 L of 2.1\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C water) treatment.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): \u2003The Tre, heart rate, and blood pressure (reported as \nmean arterial pressure) were assessed precooling and postcooling. Statistical \nanalyses included repeated-measures analysis of variance with appropriate post \nhoc t tests and Bonferroni correction.\nRESULTS: \u2003Before cooling, the Tre was not different between conditions (CON: \n39.27\u00b0C \u00b1 0.26\u00b0C, TACO: 39.30\u00b0C \u00b1 0.39\u00b0C; P = .62; effect size = -0.09; 95% \nconfidence interval [CI] = -0.2, 0.1). At postcooling, the Tre was decreased in \nthe TACO (38.10\u00b0C \u00b1 0.16\u00b0C) compared with the CON condition (38.74\u00b0C \u00b1 0.38\u00b0C; P \n< .001; effect size = 2.27; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.9). The rate of cooling was greater \nduring the TACO (0.14 \u00b1 0.06\u00b0C\/min) than the CON treatment (0.04\u00b0C\/min \u00b1 \n0.02\u00b0C\/min; t15 = -8.84; P < .001; effect size = 2.21; 95% CI = -0.13, -0.08). \nThese differences occurred despite an insignificant increase in fluid \nconsumption during exercise preceding CON (0.26 \u00b1 0.29 L) versus TACO (0.19 \u00b1 \n0.26 L; t12 = 1.73; P = .11; effect size = 0.48; 95% CI = -0.02, 0.14) \ntreatment. Decreases in heart rate did not differ between the TACO and CON \nconditions (t15 = -1.81; P = .09; effect size = 0.45; 95% CI = -22, 2). Mean \narterial pressure was greater at postcooling with TACO (84.2 \u00b1 6.6 mm Hg) than \nwith CON (67.0 \u00b1 9.0 mm Hg; P < .001; effect size = 2.25; 95% CI = 13, 21).\nCONCLUSIONS: \u2003The TACO treatment provided faster cooling than did the CON \ntreatment. When location, monetary, or spatial restrictions are present, TACO \nrepresents an effective alternative to traditional CWI in the emergency \ntreatment of patients with exertional hyperthermia.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-51.12.07\nPMCID: PMC5224736\nPMID: 27874299 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Fifteen young active \nmen completed 2 exhaustive cycling protocols (Ex1 and Ex2: 12 min at 85% \nventilatory threshold (VT) and then an intermittent exercise alternating 30-s at \n40% peak power (Ppeak) and 30 s at 90% Ppeak to exhaustion) separated by 15 min \nof (i) passive rest, (ii) 5-min cold-water immersion at 8 \u00b0C, and (iii) 10-min \ncold-water immersion at 8 \u00b0C. Core temperature, heart rate, rates of perceived \nexertion, and oxygen uptake kinetics were not different during Ex1 among \nconditions. Time to failure during the intermittent exercise was significantly \n(P < 0.05) longer during Ex2 following the 5- and 10-min cold-water immersions \n(7.2 \u00b1 3.5 min and 7.3 \u00b1 3.3 min, respectively) compared with passive rest (5.8 \n\u00b1 3.1 min). Core temperature, heart rate, and rates of perceived exertion were \nsignificantly (P < 0.05) lower during most periods of Ex2 after both cold-water \nimmersions compared with passive rest. The time constant of phase II oxygen \nuptake response during the 85% VT bout of Ex2 was not different among the 3 \nconditions.

A key assumption about the benefits of cold water immersion \nis that it reduces inflammation in skeletal muscle. However, no data are \navailable from humans to support this notion. We compared the effects of cold \nwater immersion and active recovery on inflammatory and cellular stress \nresponses in skeletal muscle from exercise-trained men 2, 24 and 48\u00a0h during \nrecovery after acute resistance exercise. Exercise led to the infiltration of \ninflammatory cells, with increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines \nand neurotrophins, and the subcellular translocation of heat shock proteins in \nmuscle. These responses did not differ significantly between cold water \nimmersion and active recovery. Our results suggest that cold water immersion is \nno more effective than active recovery for minimizing the inflammatory and \nstress responses in muscle after resistance exercise.\nABSTRACT: Cold water immersion and active recovery are common post-exercise \nrecovery treatments. However, little is known about whether these treatments \ninfluence inflammation and cellular stress in human skeletal muscle after \nexercise. We compared the effects of cold water immersion versus active recovery \non inflammatory cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophins and heat shock \nproteins (HSPs) in skeletal muscle after intense resistance exercise. Nine \nactive men performed unilateral lower-body resistance exercise on separate days, \nat least 1\u00a0week apart. On one day, they immersed their lower body in cold water \n(10\u00b0C) for 10\u00a0min after exercise. On the other day, they cycled at a low \nintensity for 10\u00a0min after exercise. Muscle biopsies were collected from the \nexercised leg before, 2, 24 and 48\u00a0h after exercise in both trials. Exercise \nincreased intramuscular neutrophil and macrophage counts, MAC1 and CD163 mRNA \nexpression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Exercise also increased IL1\u03b2, TNF, IL6, CCL2, CCL4, \nCXCL2, IL8 and LIF mRNA expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). As evidence of hyperalgesia, the \nexpression of NGF and GDNF mRNA increased after exercise (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The \ncytosolic protein content of \u03b1B-crystallin and HSP70 decreased after exercise \n(P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This response was accompanied by increases in the cytoskeletal \nprotein content of \u03b1B-crystallin and the percentage of type II fibres stained \nfor \u03b1B-crystallin. Changes in inflammatory cells, cytokines, neurotrophins and \nHSPs did not differ significantly between the recovery treatments. These \nfindings indicate that cold water immersion is no more effective than active \nrecovery for reducing inflammation or cellular stress in muscle after a bout of \nresistance exercise.\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

VEGFtotal mRNA increased after CWI only (~2.4-fold) compared \nwith CONT (~1.1-fold) at 3\u00a0h post-exercise (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Study 2 Following CWI, \nPGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression was significantly increased ~1.3-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and \n1.4-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) at 3 and 6\u00a0h, respectively. Similarly, VEGF165 mRNA was \nsignificantly increased in CWI ~1.9-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and 2.2-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) at \n3 and 6\u00a0h post-immersion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Data confirm post-exercise CWI augments the acute exercise-induced \nexpression of PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA in human skeletal muscle compared to exercise per se. \nAdditionally CWI per se mediates the activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and VEGF mRNA \nexpression in human skeletal muscle.

Treatments were reversed in the second \nsession (after 1 week).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine \naminotransferase enzymes; perceived muscle soreness; and recovery through visual \nanalogue scales and muscle power of the upper and lower limbs at pretraining, \npostrecovery, 24 hours, and 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Athletes who underwent CWI showed better posttraining recovery measures \nbecause circulating LDH levels were lower at 24 hours postrecovery in the CWI \ncondition (441.9 \u00b1 81.4 IU\/L) than in the control condition (493.6 \u00b1 97.4 IU\/L; \nP = .03). Estimated muscle power was higher in the CWI than in the control \ncondition for both upper limbs (757.9 \u00b1 125.1 W versus 695.9 \u00b1 56.1 W) and lower \nlimbs (53.7 \u00b1 3.7 cm versus 35.5 \u00b1 8.2 cm; both P values = .001). In addition, \nwe observed less perceived muscle soreness (1.5 \u00b1 1.1 arbitrary units [au] \nversus 3.1 \u00b1 1.0 au; P = .004) and higher perceived recovery (8.8 \u00b1 1.9 au \nversus 6.9 \u00b1 1.7 au; P = .005) in the CWI than in the control condition at 24 \nhours postrecovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of CWI can be beneficial to jiu-jitsu athletes because it \nreduces circulating LDH levels, results in less perceived muscle soreness, and \nhelps muscle power recovery at 24 hours postrecovery.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-51.9.01\nPMCID: PMC5317190\nPMID: 27575565 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This \nstudy was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of IM and CMI on tissue \ntemperature and potential benefit to preventing DOMS. The research encompassed \n36 subjects divided into three groups of twelve depending on the form of \nrecovery: ice massage (IM), cold-water immersion (CWI), or passive recovery \n(PAS). All the participants were asked to jump as high as possible from a full \nsquat for one minute. Thermal imaging was conducted at rest, immediately \nfollowing the exercise, immediately after the trial, following the recovery \ntreatment, and after 30min of rest. Their pain levels were assessed using the \nVisual Analogue Scale (VAS). After applying the selected method for supporting \nrecovery, the LA level decreased by 4.25mmol\/L in the IM group, and by \n4.96mmol\/L in the CWI group (IM vs. CWI p>0.05). The 2.75mmol\/L decrease in \nlactate concentration in the PAS group was significantly lower than in the other \ngroups (IM vs. PAS p<0.05\/ CWI vs. PAS p<0.01). In both groups, Tsk after 30min \nwas significantly lower (\u0394Tsk~0.5\u00b0C) than at rest (p<0.05). In turn, Tsk in the \nPAS group returned to the resting values (p>0.05). Seventy-two hours after the \nexercise, a clear decrease in discomfort was observed in the IM and CWI groups \ncompared to the PAS group. The two applied treatments have proven to be \neffective both in utilizing lactate and preventing DOMS. Depending on training \nrequirements, we recommend the use of IM when athletes experience localized \nmuscle fatigue. One the other hand, CWI is recommended in situations of global \nor generalized muscle injury or fatigue.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the effects of CWI using \ndifferent temperatures and the dose-response relationship of this technique have \nnot yet been investigated. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of \ntwo strategies of CWI, using different water temperatures with passive recovery \npost exercise in the management of some markers of muscle damage, and to observe \nwhether any of the techniques used caused deleterious effects on performance. \nSixty healthy male participants performed an eccentric protocol to induce muscle \ndamage and were then randomized to one of three groups (CWI1: 15\u00a0min at 9\u00a0\u00b0C; \nCWI2: 15\u00a0min at 14\u00a0\u00b0C; CG: control group). Levels of creatine kinase, muscle \nsoreness, pain threshold, perception of recovery, and maximal voluntary \nisometric contraction were monitored up to 96\u00a0h post exercise. A large effect \nfor time for all outcomes was observed [P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; CK (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.516), muscle \nsoreness (ES\u00a0= 0.368); pain threshold (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.184); perception of recovery \n(ES\u00a0=\u00a00.565); MVIC (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.273)]. CWI groups presented an earlier recovery for \nmuscle soreness with lower ratings immediately post recovery. For delayed \neffects, the application of CWI2 (15\u00a0min at 14\u00a0\u00b0C) presented earlier recovery \ncompared with CWI1 and control condition for maximal voluntary isometric \ncontraction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were no significant group and interaction (Group \u00d7 \nTime) effects. CWI groups acted more efficiently for muscle soreness and \nperformance considering the time of recovery was observed.

Immediately postexercise, subjects \nwere exposed in a randomized crossover design to CWI (10 min at 10\u00b0C) or WBC (3 \nmin at -110\u00b0C) recovery. Creatine kinase concentrations, knee-flexor eccentric \n(60\u00b0\/s) and posterior lower-limb isometric (60\u00b0) strength, single-leg and 2-leg \ncountermovement jumps, muscle soreness, and perception of recovery were \nmeasured. The tests were performed before and immediately, 24, 48, and 72 h \nafter exercise.\nRESULTS: Results showed a very likely moderate effect in favor of CWI for \nsingle-leg (effect size [ES] = 0.63; 90% confidence interval [CI] = -0.13 to \n1.38) and 2-leg countermovement jump (ES = 0.68; 90% CI = -0.08 to 1.43) 72 h \nafter exercise. Soreness was moderately lower 48 h after exercise after CWI (ES \n= -0.68; 90% CI = -1.44 to 0.07). Perception of recovery was moderately enhanced \n24 h after exercise for CWI (ES = -0.62; 90% CI = -1.38 to 0.13). Trivial and \nsmall effects of condition were found for the other outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI was more effective than WBC in accelerating recovery kinetics \nfor countermovement-jump performance at 72 h postexercise. CWI also demonstrated \nlower soreness and higher perceived recovery levels across 24-48 h postexercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2016-0186\nPMID: 27396361 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

J Strength Cond Res 31(3): 620-629, 2017-The purpose of \nthis investigation was to assess the effect of combining practical methods to \ncool the body on endurance running performance and physiology in the heat. \nEleven trained male runners completed 4 randomized, preloaded running time \ntrials (20 minutes at 70% V[Combining Dot Above]O2max and a 3 km time trial) on \na nonmotorized treadmill in the heat (33\u00b0 C). Trials consisted of precooling by \ncombined cold-water immersion and ice slurry ingestion (PRE), midcooling by \ncombined facial water spray and menthol mouth rinse (MID), a combination of all \nmethods (ALL), and control (CON). Performance time was significantly faster in \nMID (13.7 \u00b1 1.2 minutes; p < 0.01) and ALL (13.7 \u00b1 1.4 minutes; p = 0.04) but \nnot PRE (13.9 \u00b1 1.4 minutes; p = 0.24) when compared with CON (14.2 \u00b1 1.2 \nminutes). Precooling significantly reduced rectal temperature (initially by 0.5 \n\u00b1 0.2\u00b0 C), mean skin temperature, heart rate and sweat rate, and increased iEMG \nactivity, whereas midcooling significantly increased expired air volume and \nrespiratory exchange ratio compared with control. Significant decreases in \nforehead temperature, thermal sensation, and postexercise blood prolactin \nconcentration were observed in all conditions compared with control. Performance \nwas improved with midcooling, whereas precooling had little or no influence. \nMidcooling may have improved performance through an attenuated inhibitory \npsychophysiological and endocrine response to the heat.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000001532\nPMID: 27379961 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The current recommended treatment of EHS is \ncold-water immersion; however, limitations may require the use of alternative \nresources such as a cold shower (CS) or dousing with a hose to cool EHS \npatients.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the cooling effectiveness of a CS after \nexercise-induced hyperthermia.\nDESIGN: Randomized, crossover controlled study.\nSETTING: Environmental chamber (temperature = 33.4\u00b0C \u00b1 2.1\u00b0C; relative humidity \n= 27.1% \u00b1 1.4%).\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen participants (10 male, 7 female; \nheight = 1.75 \u00b1 0.07 m, body mass = 70.4 \u00b1 8.7 kg, body surface area = 1.85 \u00b1 \n0.13 m(2), age range = 19-35 years) volunteered.\nINTERVENTION(S): On 2 occasions, participants completed matched-intensity \nvolitional exercise on an ergometer or treadmill to elevate rectal temperature \nto \u226539\u00b0C or until participant fatigue prevented continuation (reaching at least \n38.5\u00b0C). They were then either treated with a CS (20.8\u00b0C \u00b1 0.80\u00b0C) or seated in \nthe chamber (control [CON] condition) for 15 minutes.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rectal temperature, calculated cooling rate, heart \nrate, and perceptual measures (thermal sensation and perceived muscle pain).\nRESULTS: The rectal temperature (P = .98), heart rate (P = .85), thermal \nsensation (P = .69), and muscle pain (P = .31) were not different during \nexercise for the CS and CON trials (P > .05). Overall, the cooling rate was \nfaster during CS (0.07\u00b0C\/min \u00b1 0.03\u00b0C\/min) than during CON (0.04\u00b0C\/min \u00b1 \n0.03\u00b0C\/min; t16 = 2.77, P = .01). Heart-rate changes were greater during CS (45 \n\u00b1 20 beats per minute) compared with CON (27 \u00b1 10 beats per minute; t16 = 3.32, \nP = .004). Thermal sensation was reduced to a greater extent with CS than with \nCON (F3,45 = 41.12, P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the CS facilitated cooling rates faster than no treatment, \nclinicians should continue to advocate for accepted cooling modalities and use \nCS only if no other validated means of cooling are available.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-51.4.01\nPMCID: PMC4852530\nPMID: 26942657 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Additionally, increased translational \ncapacity via elevated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis has also been implicated in \nresistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The time course of \nribosome biogenesis following resistance exercise (RE) and the impact exerted by \ndiffering recovery strategies remains unknown. In the present study, the \nactivation of transcriptional regulators, the expression levels of pre-rRNA, and \nmature rRNA components were measured through 48\u00a0h after a single-bout RE. In \naddition, the effects of either low-intensity cycling (active recovery, ACT) or \na cold-water immersion (CWI) recovery strategy were compared. Nine male subjects \nperformed two bouts of high-load RE randomized to be followed by 10\u00a0min of \neither ACT or CWI. Muscle biopsies were collected before RE and at 2, 24, and \n48\u00a0h after RE. RE increased the phosphorylation of the p38-MNK1-eIF4E axis, an \neffect only evident with ACT recovery. Downstream, cyclin D1 protein, total \neIF4E, upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1), and c-Myc proteins were all increased \nonly after RE with ACT. This corresponded with elevated abundance of the \npre-rRNAs (45S, ITS-28S, ITS-5.8S, and ETS-18S) from 24\u00a0h after RE with ACT. In \nconclusion, coordinated upstream signaling and activation of transcriptional \nfactors stimulated pre-rRNA expression after RE. CWI, as a recovery strategy, \nmarkedly blunted these events, suggesting that suppressed ribosome biogenesis \nmay be one factor contributing to the impaired hypertrophic response observed \nwhen CWI is used regularly after exercise.\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Given the effects of cold water \nimmersion on blood flow, evaluating in vivo changes in tissue oxygenation during \ncold water immersion may help further our understanding of this recovery \nmodality. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cold water immersion on \nmuscle oxygenation and performance during repeated bouts of fatiguing exercise \nin a group of healthy young adults. Twenty healthy subjects performed 2 \nfatiguing bouts of maximal dynamic knee extension and flexion contractions both \nconcentrically on an isokinetic dynamometer with a 10-min recovery period in \nbetween. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a cold water immersion \n(treatment) or passive recovery (control) group. Changes in muscle oxygenation \nwere monitored continuously using near-infrared spectroscopy. Muscle performance \nwas measured with isokinetic dynamometry during each fatiguing bout. Skin \ntemperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle soreness ratings were also \nassessed. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used to evaluate treatment \neffects. The treatment group had a significantly lower mean heart rate and lower \nskin temperature compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Cold water immersion \nattenuated a reduction in tissue oxygenation in the second fatiguing bout by 4% \nwhen compared with control. Muscle soreness was rated lower 1 day post-testing \n(P < 0.05). However, cold water immersion had no significant effect on muscle \nperformance in subsequent exercise. As the results show that cold water \nimmersion attenuated decreased tissue oxygenation in subsequent exercise \nperformance, the metabolic response to exercise after cold water immersion is \nworthy of further exploration.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/MD.0000000000002455\nPMCID: PMC4706272\nPMID: 26735552 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interests exist.",

Parasympathetic reactivation was determined via the natural \nlogarithm of the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of \ndifferences between adjacent R-R intervals (ln rMSSD). RS performance was \ncalculated as time taken (s) to complete 6 \u00d7 30-m sprints within the first half \nof each match.\nRESULTS: There were large increases in postintervention ln rMSSD between CWI and \nPAS after all matches (ES 90% CL: +1.13; \u00b10.21). Average heart rate (HR) during \nthe RS performance task (HRAverage RS) was impaired from baseline from match 3 \nonward for both conditions. However, HRAverage RS was higher with CWI than with \nPAS (ES 90% CL: 0.58; \u00b10.58). Peak HR during the RS performance task (HRPeak RS) \nwas similarly impaired from baseline for match 3 onward during PAS and for match \n4 onward with CWI. HRPeak RS was very likely higher with CWI than with PAS (ES \n90% CL: +0.80; \u00b10.56). No effects of match or condition were observed for RS \nperformance, although there were moderate correlations between the changes in \nHRAverage RS (r 90% CL: -0.33; \u00b10.14), HRPeak RS (r 90% CL: -0.38; \u00b10.13), and \nRS performance.\nCONCLUSION: CWI facilitated cardiac parasympathetic reactivation after a \nsimulated rugby sevens match.

Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h \nafter exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion \nmolecule (NCAM) (10-30%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50%) increased 24-48 \nh after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h \nafter exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers \nwere greater after ACT than after CWI (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 \nkinase(Thr421\/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was \ngreater after ACT (P < 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute \nchanges in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle \nhypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle \nstrength and hypertrophy. The use of CWI as a regular post-exercise recovery \nstrategy should be reconsidered.\n\n\u00a9 2015 The Authors.

Cardiac output was measured non-invasively with an inert gas rebreathing \nmethod prior to and immediately after the first sauna exposure and after \ncold-water immersion, respectively. Blood pressure was measured before, twice \nduring and after sauna. The autonomic nervous system was assessed by power \nspectral analysis of heart rate variability. Total power, low-frequency and \nhigh-frequency components were evaluated. The low frequency\/high frequency ratio \nwas used as a marker of sympathovagal balance. Sauna and cold-water immersion \nwere well tolerated by all subjects.\nRESULTS: Cardiac output and heart rate significantly increased in all groups \nafter sauna and cold-water immersion (p\u2009<\u20090.05), except for coronary artery \ndisease patients after sauna exposure. Systolic blood pressure during sauna \ndecreased significantly in all groups with a nadir after 6\u2009min (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). \nCold-water immersion significantly increased systolic blood pressure in all \ngroups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No change in the low\/high frequency ratio was found in \nchronic heart failure patients. In coronary artery disease patients and controls \na prolonged increase in low frequency\/high frequency ratio was observed after \nthe first sauna exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to Finnish sauna and cold-water immersion causes \nhaemodynamic alterations in chronic heart failure patients similarly to control \nsubjects and in particular did not provoke an excessive increase in adrenergic \nactivity or complex arrhythmias.\n\n\u00a9 The European Society of Cardiology 2015.\n\nDOI: 10.1177\/2047487315594506\nPMID: 26152773 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Dr Thain is now at Faculty of Health and Social \nSciences, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom.\n\nCONTEXT: Cryotherapy is used widely in sport and exercise medicine to manage \nacute injuries and facilitate rehabilitation. The analgesic effects of \ncryotherapy are well established; however, a potential caveat is that cooling \ntissue negatively affects neuromuscular control through delayed muscle reaction \ntime. This topic is important to investigate because athletes often return to \nexercise, rehabilitation, or competitive activity immediately or shortly after \ncryotherapy.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of wet-ice application, cold-water immersion, \nand an untreated control condition on peroneus longus and tibialis anterior \nmuscle reaction time during a simulated lateral ankle sprain.\nDESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial.\nSETTING: University of Hertfordshire human performance laboratory.\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 54 physically active individuals (age \n= 20.1 \u00b1 1.5 years, height = 1.7 \u00b1 0.07 m, mass = 66.7 \u00b1 5.4 kg) who had no \ninjury or history of ankle sprain.\nINTERVENTION(S): Wet-ice application, cold-water immersion, or an untreated \ncontrol condition applied to the ankle for 10 minutes.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Muscle reaction time and muscle amplitude of the \nperoneus longus and tibialis anterior in response to a simulated lateral ankle \nsprain were calculated. The ankle-sprain simulation incorporated a combined \ninversion and plantar-flexion movement.\nRESULTS: We observed no change in muscle reaction time or muscle amplitude after \ncryotherapy for either the peroneus longus or tibialis anterior (P > .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Ten minutes of joint cooling did not adversely affect muscle \nreaction time or muscle amplitude in response to a simulated lateral ankle \nsprain. These findings suggested that athletes can safely return to sporting \nactivity immediately after icing. Further evidence showed that ice can be \napplied before ankle rehabilitation without adversely affecting dynamic \nneuromuscular control. Investigation in patients with acute ankle sprains is \nwarranted to assess the clinical applicability of these interventions.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-50.4.05\nPMCID: PMC4532180\nPMID: 26067429 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, the physiological effects of CWI and \nACT after resistance exercise are not well characterized. We examined the \neffects of CWI and ACT on cardiac output (Q\u0307), muscle oxygenation (SmO2), blood \nvolume (tHb), muscle temperature (Tmuscle), and isometric strength after \nresistance exercise. On separate days, 10 men performed resistance exercise, \nfollowed by 10 min CWI at 10\u00b0C or 10 min ACT (low-intensity cycling). Q\u0307 (7.9 \u00b1 \n2.7 l) and Tmuscle (2.2 \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C) increased, whereas SmO2 (-21.5 \u00b1 8.8%) and tHb \n(-10.1 \u00b1 7.7 \u03bcM) decreased after exercise (P < 0.05). During CWI, Q\u0307 (-1.1 \u00b1 0.7 \nl) and Tmuscle (-6.6 \u00b1 5.3\u00b0C) decreased, while tHb (121 \u00b1 77 \u03bcM) increased (P < \n0.05). In the hour after CWI, Q\u0307 and Tmuscle remained low, while tHb also \ndecreased (P < 0.05). By contrast, during ACT, Q\u0307 (3.9 \u00b1 2.3 l), Tmuscle (2.2 \u00b1 \n0.5\u00b0C), SmO2 (17.1 \u00b1 5.7%), and tHb (91 \u00b1 66 \u03bcM) all increased (P < 0.05). In \nthe hour after ACT, Tmuscle, and tHb remained high (P < 0.05). Peak isometric \nstrength during 10-s maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) did not change \nsignificantly after CWI, whereas it decreased after ACT (-30 to -45 Nm; P < \n0.05). Muscle deoxygenation time during MVCs increased after ACT (P < 0.05), but \nnot after CWI. Muscle reoxygenation time after MVCs tended to increase after CWI \n(P = 0.052).

In the field, however, treatment is often delayed due to \ndelayed paramedic response and\/or inaccurate diagnosis. We examined the effect \nof treatment (reduction of rectal temperature to 37.5\u2009\u00b0C) delays of 5, 20, and \n40\u2009min on core cooling rates in eight exertionally heat-stressed (40.0\u2009\u00b0C rectal \ntemperature) individuals. We found that rectal temperature was elevated above \nbaseline (P\u2009<\u20090.05) at the end of all delay periods (5\u2009min: 40.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32; \n20\u2009min: 39.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40; 40\u2009min: 39.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\u2009\u00b0C).

The main aim of this study was to compare physiological and \npsychological reactions between people who exhibited fast cooling (FC; n = 20) \nor slow cooling (SC; n = 20) responses to cold water immersion. Individuals in \nwhom the T(re) decreased to a set point of 35.5 \u00b0C before the end of the 170-min \ncooling time were indicated as the FC group; individuals in whom the T(re) did \nnot decrease to the set point of 35.5 \u00b0C before the end of the 170-min cooling \ntime were classified as the SC group. Cold stress was induced using intermittent \nimmersion in bath water at 14 \u00b0C. Motor (spinal and supraspinal reflexes, \nvoluntary and electrically induced skeletal muscle contraction force) and \ncognitive (executive function, short term memory, short term spatial \nrecognition) performance, immune variables (neutrophils, leucocytes, \nlymphocytes, monocytes, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal \naxis activity (cortisol, corticosterone) and autonomic nervous system activity \n(epinephrine, norepinephrine) were monitored. The data obtained in this study \nsuggest that the response of the FC group to cooling vs the SC group response \nwas more likely an insulative-hypothermic response and that the SC vs the FC \ngroup displayed a metabolic-insulative response. The observations that an \nexposure time to 14 \u00b0C cold water--which was nearly twice as short (96-min vs \n170-min) with a greater rectal temperature decrease (35.5 \u00b0C vs 36.2 \u00b0C) in the \nFC group compared with the SC group--induces similar responses of motor, \ncognitive, and blood stress markers were novel.

Circulating \nmediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken \npre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h \npost-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a \n10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time \npoints.\nRESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately \npost-exercise in all conditions. IL-6 remained elevated from baseline at 2 h in \nthe CWI-30 min \u00d7 20 \u00b0C, CWI-10 min \u00d7 10 \u00b0C, and CWI-30 min \u00d7 10 \u00b0C conditions, \nwhile further increases were observed for IL-8 and MPO in the CWI-30 min \u00d7 20 \u00b0C \nand CWI-30 min \u00d7 10 \u00b0C conditions. Squat jump and drop jump height were \nsignificantly lower in all conditions immediately post-exercise and at 2 h. Drop \njump remained below baseline at 24 and 48 h in the CON and CWI-10 min \u00d7 20 \u00b0C \nconditions only, while squat jump height returned to baseline in all conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cold-water immersion appears to facilitate restoration of muscle \nperformance in a stretch-shortening cycle, but not concentric power. These \nchanges do not appear to be related to inflammatory modulation. CWI protocols of \nexcessive duration may actually exacerbate the concentration of cytokines in \ncirculation post-exercise; however, the origin of the circulating cytokines is \nnot necessarily skeletal muscle.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-014-2954-2\nPMID: 25074283 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

A second 50 m sprint followed after a second 15-minute recovery period \nwith passive immersion in either warm (WI, 30 \u00b0C), or cool water (CI, 26.7 \u00b0C). \nIn a crossover design, all subjects repeated the trial 48 hours later utilizing \nthe alternate immersion temperature. During the 50-m sprints, time and stroke \ncharacteristics were recorded. Blood lactate and heart rates were measured \nbefore and after the trials. Strength and flexibility were recorded before and \nafter immersions and ratings of perceived exertion were evaluated.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in time, event velocity, or \nstroke rate, between any of the trials. With WI, a significant reduction of \nhandgrip strength was observed (P=0.029) with lower ratings of perceived \nexertion observed after the sprint. Higher resting lactate levels were recorded, \nprior to swimming, after both the 15-minute WI and CI water recoveries (P<0.01) \nas compared to NI. No correlation was observed between swim performance times \nand starting or peak lactate levels, with any type of recovery intervention \n(R2=0.047; slope NS from zero).\nCONCLUSION: Recovery by cool (26.7 \u00b0C) or warm (30 \u00b0C) water immersion does not \naffect velocity or stroke characteristics in a 50-m freestyle sprint, even when \nwidely employed performance related determinants such as resting lactate levels \nand perceived exertion are not optimal.\n\nPMID: 25028983 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Rapidly reducing core temperatures will likely increase safety as \nfirefighters are redeployed to subsequent operational tasks. This study \ninvestigated the effectiveness of cold-water immersion (CWI) and iced-slush \ningestion (SLUSH) to cool firefighters post-incident. Seventy-four Australian \nfirefighters (mean \u00b1 SD age: 38.9 \u00b1 9.0 years) undertook a simulated search and \nrescue task in a heat chamber (105 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C). Testing involved two 20-min work \ncycles separated by a 10-min rest period. Ambient temperature during recovery \nperiods was 19.3 \u00b1 2.7 \u00b0C. Participants were randomly assigned one of three \n15-min cooling protocols: (i) CWI, 15 \u00b0C to umbilicus; (ii) SLUSH, 7 g\u00b7kg(-1) \nbody weight; or (iii) seated rest (CONT). Core temperature and strength were \nmeasured pre- and postsimulation and directly after cooling. Mean temperatures \nfor all groups reached 38.9 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b0C at the conclusion of the second work task. \nBoth CWI and SLUSH delivered cooling rates in excess of CONT (0.093 and 0.092 \ncompared with 0.058 \u00b0C\u00b7min(-1)) and reduced temperatures to baseline \nmeasurements within the 15-min cooling period. Grip strength was not negatively \nimpacted by either SLUSH or CONT. CWI and SLUSH provide evidence-based \nalternatives to passive recovery and forearm immersion protocols currently \nadopted by many fire services. To maximise the likelihood of adoption, we \nrecommend SLUSH ingestion as a practical and effective cooling strategy for \npost-incident cooling of firefighters in temperate regions.\n\nDOI: 10.1139\/apnm-2014-0038\nPMID: 25017114 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system \nattenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous \nsystem and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be \nvoluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program \non the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers \nwere randomized to either the intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). \nSubjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third \neye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by \nbreath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). \nThe control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent \nexperimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng\/kg Escherichia coli \nendotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques \nresulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in \nprofoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, \nplasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly \nafter endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine \nlevels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and \nIL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 \nlevels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In \nconclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous \nsystem results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate \nimmune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important \nimplications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or \npersistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1073\/pnas.1322174111\nPMCID: PMC4034215\nPMID: 24799686 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

This study \nexamined the physiological merit of CWI for recovery from high-intensity \nexercise by investigating if the placebo effect is responsible for any acute \nperformance or psychological benefits.\nMETHODS: Thirty males (mean \u00b1 SD: age, 24 \u00b1 5 yr; VO2 peak, 51.1 \u00b1 7.0 mL \u00b7 \nkg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1)) performed an acute high-intensity interval training session, \ncomprised of 4 \u00d7 30-s sprints, immediately followed by one of the following \nthree 15-min recovery conditions: CWI (10.3\u00b0C \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C), thermoneutral water \nimmersion placebo (TWP) (34.7\u00b0C \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C), or thermoneutral water immersion \ncontrol (TWI) (34.7\u00b0C \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C). An intramuscular thermistor was inserted during \nexercise and recovery to record muscle temperature. Swelling (thigh girth), pain \nthreshold\/tolerance, interleukin 6 concentration, and total leukocyte, \nneutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were recorded at baseline, postexercise, \npostrecovery, and 1, 24, and 48 h postexercise. A maximal voluntary isometric \ncontraction (MVC) of the quadriceps was performed at the same time points, with \nthe exception of postexercise. Self-assessments of readiness for exercise, \nfatigue, vigor, sleepiness, pain, and belief of recovery effectiveness were also \ncompleted.\nRESULTS: Leg strength after the MVC and ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, \nand vigor were significantly impaired in TWI compared with those in CWI and TWP \nwhich were similar to each other.\nCONCLUSIONS: A recovery placebo administered after an acute high-intensity \ninterval training session is superior in the recovery of muscle strength over 48 \nh as compared with TWI and is as effective as CWI. This can be attributed to \nimproved ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, and vigor, suggesting that the \ncommonly hypothesized physiological benefits surrounding CWI are at least partly \nplacebo related.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0000000000000348\nPMID: 24674975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

No \ndifferences between groups were observed for CK; however, PL-CWI had \nsignificantly greater elevations in myoglobin 30-min post-exercise compared to \nHMB-FA (p = 0.009) and PL (p = 0.005), and HMB-FA-CWI was significantly greater \nthan HMB-FA (p = 0.046) and PL (p = 0.028). No differences between groups were \nobserved for IL-6 and IL-10, although CRP was significantly greater 24-h \npost-exercise for PL-CWI compared to HMB-FA-CWI (p = 0.02) and HMB-FA (p = \n0.046). Only HMB-FA-CWI showed significantly (p = 0.02) greater improvements in \naverage power per repetition. CWI appeared to elevate myoglobin compared to \nother groups, while HMB-FA may have attenuated the increase in CRP when combined \nwith CWI. Nevertheless, HMB-FA or CWI treatments did not appear to provide \nbenefit over PL for recovery.

The purpose of this study \nwas to analyze the influence of cryotherapy on postural sway in healthy males. \nTwenty-six subjects were randomly assigned into two intervention groups: control \n(tepid water at \u223c26\u00b0C) or ice (cold water at \u223c11\u00b0C). Postural sway was measured \nthrough the center of pressure (COP) position while they stood on a force plate \nduring bipedal (70 s) and unipedal (40 s) conditions before and after the \nsubjects were immersed in a water tub up to the umbilical level for 20 min. COP \nstandard deviation (SD) and COP velocity were analyzed in the anterior-posterior \n(AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. Statistical analysis showed that in the \nbipedal condition cryotherapy increased the COP SD and COP velocity in the ML \ndirection. During the unipedal condition, a higher COP velocity in the AP and ML \ndirections was also reported. Our findings indicate that cryotherapy by \nimmersing the whole lower limb should be used with caution before engaging in \nchallenging postural control activities.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Enhancing recovery from resistance training may improve \nthe muscle-remodeling processes, stimulating a faster return to peak \nperformance.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of 2 different recovery modalities, \nneuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and cold-water immersion (CWI), on \nperformance and biochemical and ultrasonographic measures.\nPARTICIPANTS: Thirty resistance-trained men (23.1 \u00b1 2.9 y, 175.2 \u00b1 7.1 cm, 82.1 \n\u00b1 8.4 kg) were randomly assigned to NMES, CWI, or control (CON).\nDESIGN AND SETTING: All participants completed a high-volume lower-body \nresistance-training workout on d 1 and returned to the human performance \nlaboratory 24 (24H) and 48 h (48 H) postexercise for follow-up testing.\nMEASURES: Blood samples were obtained preexercise (PRE) and immediately (IP), 30 \nmin (30 P), 24 h (24H), and 48 h (48 H) post. Subjects were examined for \nperformance changes in the squat exercise (total repetitions and average power \nper repetition), biomarkers of inflammation, and changes in cross-sectional area \nand echo intensity (EI) of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis muscles.\nRESULTS: No differences between groups were observed in the number of \nrepetitions (P = .250; power: P = .663). Inferential-based analysis indicated \nthat increases in C-reactive protein concentrations were likely increased by a \ngreater magnitude after CWI compared with CON, while NMES possibly decreased \nmore than CON from IP to 24H. Increases in interleukin-10 concentrations between \nIP and 30 P were likely greater in CWI than NMES but not different from CON. \nInferential-based analysis of RF EI indicated a likely decrease for CWI between \nIP and 48 H. No other differences between groups were noted in any other \nmuscle-architecture measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that CWI induced greater increases in pro- and \nanti-inflammatory markers, while decreasing RF EI, suggesting that CWI may be \neffective in enhancing short-term muscle recovery after high-volume bouts of \nresistance exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/jsr.2013-0113\nPMID: 24622577 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Each trial consisted of 2 exercise tasks separated by \n1 h. The first was a 60-min constant-load trial at 55% of the maximal power \noutput followed by a 30-min time trial (TT1). The second comprised a 12-min \nsimulated time trial (TT2). After TT1, AR, PR, or CWI was applied for 15 min.\nRESULTS: No significant TT2 performance differences were observed, but a \n1-sample t test (within each condition) revealed different pacing strategies \nduring TT2. CWI resulted in an even pacing strategy, while AR and PR resulted in \na gradual decline of power output after the onset of TT2 (P \u2264 .046). During \nrecovery, AR and CWI showed a trend toward faster blood lactate ([BLa]) removal, \nbut during TT2 significantly higher [BLa] was only observed after CWI compared \nwith PR (P = .011).\nCONCLUSION: The pacing strategy during subsequent cycling performance in the \nheat is influenced by the application of different postexercise recovery \ninterventions. Although power was not significantly altered between groups, CWI \nenabled a differently shaped power profile, likely due to decreased thermal \nstrain.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2012-0366\nPMID: 24571917 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After exercise, subjects immersed \none leg in a cold water bath (10\u00b0C, COLD) to the level of their gluteal fold for \n15 min. The contralateral leg remained outside the water bath and served as \ncontrol (CON). Core body temperature was monitored throughout the experiment, \nwhereas muscle biopsies and muscle temperature (Tm) measurements were obtained \nfrom the vastus lateralis before exercise (PRE), immediately postexercise \n(POST-EX, Tm only), immediately after cooling, and 3 h postexercise (POST-3H).\nRESULTS: Exercise significantly increased core body temperature (PRE, 37.1\u00b0C \u00b1 \n0.4\u00b0C vs POST-EX, 39.3\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C, P < 0.001) and Tm in both CON (PRE, 33.9\u00b0C \u00b1 \n0.7\u00b0C vs POST-EX, 39.1\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) and COLD legs (PRE, 34.2\u00b0C \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C vs POST-EX, \n39.4\u00b0C \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C), respectively (P < 0.001). After cooling, Tm was significantly \nlower in COLD (28.9\u00b0C \u00b1 2.3\u00b0C vs 37.0\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C, P < 0.001) whereas PGC-1\u03b1 \nmessenger RNA expression was significantly higher in COLD at POST-3H (P = \n0.014). Significant time effects were evident for changes in vascular \nendothelial growth factor (P = 0.038) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (P = \n0.019) expression. However, no significant condition effects between COLD and \nCON were evident for changes in both vascular endothelial growth factor and \nneuronal nitric oxide synthase expressions.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that an acute postexercise cooling intervention \nenhances the gene expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and may therefore provide a valuable \nstrategy to enhance exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0000000000000308\nPMID: 24561815 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Most of these studies analyzed only short-term recovery effects, \nwhereas the adaptational aspect has been widely neglected. Therefore, we \nanalyzed the effects of repeated cooling after training sessions (CWI) on \nadaptations to strength training. Seventeen trained male students volunteered \nthe study. After a 2-week familiarization period, a pretest (T1) of 1 repetition \nmaximum (RM) and 12RM was conducted followed by the 5-week strength training \nperiod (within-subject design). After the posttest (T2) and a 2-week detraining \nperiod, a retention test (T3) was carried out. Directly after each training \nsession, CWI was applied for 1 randomly assigned leg. Cooling consisted of 3 \n4-minute intervals with a 30-second rest period. The other leg was not cooled. A \nsignificant increase in 1RM and 12RM from baseline to T2 and T3 (p < 0.001), \nrespectively, and a further significant increase in 12RM from T2 to T3 (p \u2264 \n0.05) were observed. In addition, a tendency for a large leg effect with higher \nvalues for the \"control leg\" in both parameters (p = 0.08 each) and a moderate \ntime \u00d7 leg interaction in favor of the control leg was found (1RM: p = 0.11; \n12RM: p = 0.09). The percentage change differences between both conditions were \n1.6% for the increase in 1RM from T1 to T2 and 2.0% from T1 to T3 in favor of \nthe control leg. Long-term strength training adaptations in trained subjects can \nbe negatively affected by CWI. However, effects were small, and the practical \nrelevance relative to possible recovery effects needs to be considered in a \nsports practical setting.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000000434\nPMID: 24552795 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Therefore, the present \nstudy examined the use of contrast showers as an alternative to contrast water \ntherapy for team sport recovery. In a randomized, crossover design, 10 elite \nfemale netball athletes (mean \u00b1 SD: age, 20 \u00b1 0.6 years; height, 1.82 \u00b1 0.05 m; \nbody mass, 77.0 \u00b1 9.3 kg) completed 3 experimental trials of a netball specific \ncircuit followed by one of the following 14-minute recovery interventions: (a) \ncontrast water therapy (alternating 1 minute 38\u00b0 C and 1 minute 15\u00b0 C water \nimmersion), (b) contrast showers (alternating 1 minute 38\u00b0 C and 1 minute 18\u00b0 C \nshowers), or (c) passive recovery (seated rest in 20\u00b0 C). Repeated agility, skin \nand core temperature, and perception scales were measured before, immediately \nafter, 5 and 24 hours postexercise. No significant differences in repeated \nagility were evident between conditions at any time point. No significant \ndifferences in core temperature were observed between conditions; however, skin \ntemperature was significantly lower immediately after contrast water therapy and \ncontrast showers compared with the passive condition. Overall perceptions of \nrecovery were superior after contrast water therapy and contrast showers \ncompared with passive recovery. The findings indicate contrast water therapy and \ncontrast showers did not accelerate physical recovery in elite netballers after \na netball specific circuit; however, the psychological benefit from both \ninterventions should be considered when determining the suitability of these \nrecovery interventions in team sport.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000000417\nPMID: 24531433 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We compared effects of CWI and passive \nrest on cycling performance during a simulated cycling grand tour.\nMETHODS: Thirty-four male endurance-trained competitive cyclists were randomized \nto CWI for four times per week for 15 min at 15\u00b0C or control (passive recovery) \ngroups for 7 d of baseline training, 21 d of intensified training, and an 11-d \ntaper.

Whole-body DXA scans were undertaken with \nbest practice protocol (Best) or random activity protocol (Random) at baseline, \nafter 3 weeks of overload training, and after a 2-week taper. Magnitudes of \nchanges in total, lean and fat mass from baseline-overload, overload-taper and \nbaseline-taper were assessed by standardization (\u0394mean\/SD).\nRESULTS: The standard deviations of change scores for total and fat-free soft \ntissue mass (FFST) from Random scans (2-3%) were approximately double those \nobserved in the Best (1-2%), owing to extra random errors associated with Random \nscans at baseline. There was little difference in change scores for fat mass. \nThe effect of cold water immersion therapy on baseline-taper changes in FFST was \npossibly harmful (-0.7%; 90% confidence limits \u00b11.2%) with Best scans but \nunclear with Random scans (0.9%; \u00b12.0%). Both protocols gave similar possibly \nharmful effects of cold water immersion therapy on changes in fat mass (6.9%; \n\u00b113.5% and 5.5%; \u00b114.3%, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: An interesting effect of cold water immersion therapy on \ntraining-induced changes in body composition might have been missed with a less \nprecise scanning protocol. DXA scans should be undertaken with Best.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijsnem.2013-0111\nPMID: 24458265 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We aimed to investigate whether this \nperformance effect could be attenuated by combining an active recovery (arm \nexercise) with hip-level CWI, and whether this attenuation may be related to an \neffect on core temperature (Tcore ). Participants (n\u2009=\u20098) completed three \nWingate tests before (Ex1) and after (Ex2) four different 30-min recovery \ninterventions: CWI at 15\u2009\u00b0C (CW15), arm exercise during CWI at 15\u2009\u00b0C (CW15+AE), \narm exercise during thermoneutral immersion at 34\u2009\u00b0C (TW34+AE) and non-immersed \narm exercise (AE). After AE and TW34+AE, performance during Ex2 was not \ndifferent from Ex1; while after CW15+AE and CW15, performance was reduced by \n4.9% and 7.6%, respectively. Arm exercise maintained Tcore during recovery in \nCW15+AE, while it declined to a larger extent upon commencement of Ex2 (-0.9\u2009\u00b0C) \nwhen compared with CW15 (-0.6\u2009\u00b0C). This suggests similar leg muscle cooling \nduring recovery in CW15 and CW15+AE. Without any other significant effects \n(e.g., on blood lactate), these data suggest that the improvement in sprint \nperformance following an active CWI recovery, over CWI alone, may be related to \nmaintained Tcore and its effect on neurophysiological mechanisms that drive \nmuscle activation, but not by reduced muscle cooling.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A\/S.

Between HIIT sessions, they stood in cold water (10 \n\u00b0C) up to their umbilicus, or at room temperature (27 \u00b0C) for 5 min. The natural \nlogarithm of square-root of mean squared differences of successive R-R intervals \n(ln rMSSD) was assessed pre- and post-HIIT1 and HIIT2. Stroke volume (SV), \ncardiac output (Q), O2 uptake (VO2), total muscle hemoglobin (t Hb) and \noxygenation of the vastus lateralis were recorded (using near infrared \nspectroscopy); heart rate, Q, and VO2 on-kinetics (i.e., mean response time, \nMRT), muscle de-oxygenation rate, and anaerobic contribution to exercise were \ncalculated for HIIT1 and HIIT2.\nRESULTS: ln rMSSD was likely higher [between-trial difference (90% confidence \ninterval) [+13.2% (3.3; 24.0)] after CWI compared with PAS. CWI also likely \nincreased SV [+5.9% (-0.1; 12.1)], possibly increased Q [+4.4% (-1.0; 10.3)], \npossibly slowed Q MRT [+18.3% (-4.1; 46.0)], very likely slowed VO2 MRT [+16.5% \n(5.8; 28.4)], and likely increased the anaerobic contribution to exercise [+9.7% \n(-1.7; 22.5)].\nCONCLUSION: CWI between HIIT slowed VO2 on-kinetics, leading to increased \nanaerobic contribution during HIIT2. This detrimental effect of CWI was likely \nrelated to peripheral adjustments, because the slowing of VO2 on-kinetics was \ntwofold greater than that of central delivery of O2 (i.e., Q).

This \nstudy extends previous findings by considering the influence of physical \nactivity to maintain buoyancy and subsequent swimming performance.\nMETHODS: Six inexperienced swimmers (three men and three women; mean age 22.8) \nreceived 1 wk of cold-water head-out immersions (10 x 3 min at 15 degrees C) \nalongside mental skills training to improve their treading water technique and \nto control hyperventilation upon immersion. Six inexperienced control swimmers \n(four men and two women; mean age 21.8) received immersions in temperate water \n(27 degrees C). Ventilation, brain blood flow velocity, and blood oxygenation \nwere measured during a physiological test in which participants trod water for \n150 s. In a subsequent simulated survival test, performance (swimming duration \nand distance) and perception of effort were recorded. All the tests were in 10 \ndegrees C water with the head out.\nRESULTS: There were significant improvements in the intervention group's ability \nto suppress rapid increases in respiratory frequency; 62 +\/- 24 breaths x \nmin(-1) to 33 +\/- 12. The drop in brain blood flow was smaller and more \ntransient than that previously reported due to the hypertensive response \nassociated with treading water.\nDISCUSSION: Inexperienced swimmers could benefit from cold-water habituation \ncombined with mental skills training in order to improve voluntary control over \nthe respiratory portion of the cold shock response as part of learning to tread \nwater. This may improve survival prospects in a real-life emergency scenario \nsuch as an overturned boat.\n\nDOI: 10.3357\/asem.3522.2013\nPMID: 23926662 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Recovery interventions included a mixture of 15 \nmin CWI, 3 h of wearing full-body CG, and following sleep-hygiene \nrecommendations that night, while the control condition involved postsession \nstretching and no regulation of sleeping patterns. Technical performance (stroke \nand error rates), physical performance (accelerometry, countermovement jump \n[CMJ]), physiological (heart rate, blood lactate), and perceptual (mood, \nexertion, and soreness) measures were recorded from each on-court session, along \nwith sleep quantity each night.\nRESULTS: While stroke and error rates did not differ in the drill session (P > \n.05, d < 0.20), large effects were evident for increased time in play and stroke \nrate in match play after the recovery interventions (P > .05, d > 0.90). \nAlthough accelerometry values did not differ between conditions (P > .05, d < \n0.20), CMJ tended to be improved before match play with recovery (P > .05, d = \n0.90). Furthermore, CWI and CG resulted in faster postsession reductions in \nheart rate and lactate and reduced perceived soreness (P > .05, d > 1.00). In \naddition, sleep-hygiene recommendations increased sleep quantity (P > .05, d > \n2.00) and maintained lower perceived soreness and fatigue (P < .05, d > 2.00).\nCONCLUSIONS: Mixed-method recovery interventions (CWI and CG) used after tennis \nsessions increased ensuing time in play and lower-body power and reduced \nperceived soreness. Furthermore, sleep-hygiene recommendations helped reduce \nperceived soreness.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2012-0359\nPMID: 23799825 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The \naim was to compare the effects of ice pack and cold-water immersion on the \nmuscular performance parameters of plantar flexors and muscular activation of \nthe triceps surae. 41 healthy men (mean age: 22.1 years, SD: 2.9) were randomly \nassigned to cooling with either ice pack (n=20) or cold-water immersion (n=21). \nIndependent variables were cold modality (ice pack or cold-water immersion) and \npre- and post-cooling measurement time. Dependent variables were muscular \nperformance (measured during isometric and concentric contractions of plantar \nflexors) and electromyography parameters of the triceps surae (median frequency \nand root mean square amplitude). Dependent-samples t-tests were used to compare \npre- and post-cooling data and independent-samples t-tests were used to compare \nthe difference (pre- and post-cooling) between groups. Ice pack increased \nisometric peak torque (mean: 9.00 Nm, P=0.01) and both cold modalities reduced \nmuscular activation in triceps surae (P<0.0001); Cold-water immersion and ice \npack reduced peak torque and total work during dynamic isokinetic contraction at \nboth velocities (mean: -11,00 Nm, P<0.05) and affected muscular activation in \ndifferent ways. In conclusion, ice pack increases isometric torque, while both \nice pack and cold-water immersion decrease concentric muscular performance. \nThese results indicate that these cooling methods should be chosen with caution, \nconsidering the type of task required during training or rehabilitation.

EX comprised cycling for 15 min \nat 75% peak power, then a 15-min maximal time trial. After each condition, a \nfull laboratory-based sleep study (polysomnography) was performed. Core and skin \ntemperature, heart rate, salivary melatonin, ratings of perceived fatigue, and \nrecovery were measured in each trial.\nRESULTS: No differences were observed between conditions for any whole night \nsleep measures, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset \nlatency, rapid eye movement onset latency, wake after sleep onset, or proportion \nof the night spent in different sleep stages. Core temperature in EX and CWI \ntrials was higher than CON, until it decreased below that of EX and CON until \nbedtime in CWI. After bedtime, core temperature was similar for all conditions \nthroughout the night, except for a 90-min period where it was lower for CWI than \nEX and CON (3.5-4.5 h postexercise). Heart rates for EX and CWI were both \nsignificantly higher than CON postexercise until bedtime, whereas skin \ntemperature after CWI was significantly lower than EX and CON, remaining lower \nthan EX until 3 h postexercise. Melatonin levels and recovery ratings were \nsimilar between conditions. Fatigue ratings were significantly elevated after \nexercise in both CWI and EX conditions, with EX still being elevated compared \nwith CON at bedtime.\nCONCLUSION: Whole night sleep architecture is not affected by evening exercise \nalone or when followed by CWI.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e318287f321\nPMID: 23377833 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The use of \ncold-water immersion (CWI) as a recovery strategy is common; however, the \nphysiological and biochemical rationale behind its use remains unclear. This \nstudy aimed to assess the relationship between body temperature responses to \nwater immersion and individual perception of recovery, with subsequent exercise \nperformance.\nMETHODS: Twelve male rugby players participated in a 3-week cross-over trial \nwhere an intense 60 min conditioning session was followed immediately by 15 min \nof either 14\u00b0C CWI, 30\u00b0C warm-water immersion (WWI) or passive control (CON) \nrecovery intervention. Postexercise body temperatures and subjective ratings of \nthe recovery intervention were recorded and subsequently related to performance \nin a 5\u00d740 m repeated sprint protocol undertaken 24 h later.\nRESULTS: CWI induced large reductions in core body temperature postimmersion \n(effect size (ES) range 1.05-3.21) and improved subsequent sprint performance \ncompared to WWI (ES 1.04\u00b10.84) and CON (ES 1.44\u00b10.84). Both the degree of \ntemperature decrease at 60 min postimmersion (r=0.6948; p=0.0121) and the \nsubjective rating of the recovery intervention (r=0.5886; p=0.0441) were related \nto subsequent sprint performance. A very strong linear correlation was observed \nwhen these two factors were integrated (r=0.7743; p=0.0031).\nCONCLUSION: A combination of physiological and psychological indices provides an \nimproved indication of subsequent performance and suggests an important role of \nindividual perception in enhancing training recovery.\n\nDOI: 10.1136\/bjsports-2012-091647\nPMID: 23293008 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

W.Gregson@ljmu.ac.uk\n\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that postexercise \ncold-water immersion (CWI, via its associated reductions in skeletal muscle \nblood flow) attenuates muscle glycogen resynthesis during short-term recovery \nfrom exhaustive exercise.\nMETHODS: In a repeated-measures design, nine recreationally active men performed \nan exhaustive glycogen depleting cycling protocol (consisting of intermittent \nexercise the night before and steady-state exercise on the subsequent morning of \nthe main trial) followed by 10 min of lower-limb CWI (8\u00b0C) or remained seated in \nnormal ambient conditions (CONT). Subjects were fed carbohydrate (CHO) at an \ningestion rate of 0.6 g\u00b7kg body mass at 30 min postexercise and at 1, 2, and 3 h \npostexercise.\nRESULTS: Reductions in thigh skin temperature and muscle temperature during \npostexercise recovery were greater in CWI compared with CONT (P < 0.01). In \naddition, norepinephrine and blood glucose concentrations were increased and \ndecreased, respectively, during recovery in CWI compared with CONT (P < 0.01). \nPostexercise muscle glycogen (CONT and CWI postexercise = 76 \u00b1 43 and 77 \u00b1 26 \nmmol\u00b7kg dry weight [dw], respectively; mean \u00b1 SD) progressively increased (P < \n0.01) during recovery, although rates of resynthesis did not differ (P = 0.719) \nbetween conditions (CONT and CWI 4 h postexercise = 160 \u00b1 34 and 157 \u00b1 59 \nmmol\u00b7kg dw, respectively). Total glycogen synthesis during recovery was \ncomparable (CONT and CWI = 83 \u00b1 43 and 79 \u00b1 58 mmol\u00b7kg dw, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: Postexercise CWI does not attenuate muscle glycogen resynthesis \nrates during short-term recovery even when CHO availability is considered \nsuboptimal. Athletes who regularly incorporate CWI as a recovery strategy to \nalleviate symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage should therefore not be \nconcerned with potential negative effects of the associated reductions in muscle \nblood flow on the restoration of muscle glycogen stores.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e3182814462\nPMID: 23274601 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This study examined the effect of CWI as a recovery \nstrategy on subsequent running performance in normothermic ambient conditions \n(\u223c22\u00b0C).\nDESIGN: Nine endurance-trained men completed two submaximal exhaustive running \nbouts on three separate occasions. The running bouts (Ex1 and Ex2) were \nseparated by 15min of un-immersed seated rest (CON), hip-level CWI at 8\u00b0C \n(CWI-8) or hip-level CWI at 15\u00b0C (CWI-15).\nMETHODS: Intestinal temperature, blood lactate and heart rate were recorded \nthroughout and V\u02d9O2, running economy and exercise times were recorded during the \nrunning sessions.\nRESULTS: Running time to failure (min) during Ex2 was significantly (p<0.05, \nES=0.7) longer following CWI-8 (27.7\u00b16.3) than CON (23.3\u00b15) but not different \nbetween CWI-15 (26.3\u00b13.4) and CON (p=0.06, ES=0.7) or CWI-8 and CWI-15 (p=0.4, \nES=0.2). Qualitative analyses showed a 95% and 89% likely beneficial effect of \nCWI-8 and CWI-15 during Ex2 compared with CON, respectively. Time to failure \nduring Ex2 was significantly shorter than Ex1 only during the CON condition. \nIntestinal temperature and HR were significantly lower for most of Ex2 during \nCWI-8 and CWI-15 compared with CON but they were similar at failure for the \nthree conditions. Blood lactate, running economy and V\u02d9O2 were not altered by \nCWI.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a 15min period of cold water immersion \napplied between repeated exhaustive exercise bouts significantly reduces \nintestinal temperature and enhances post-immersion running performance in \nnormothermic conditions.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Sports Medicine Australia.

Twenty active male subjects \nwere randomly assigned to a 4-min exposure of WBC or CWI. A minimum of 7 days \nlater subjects were exposed to the other treatment. Muscle temperature in the \nright vastus lateralis (n=10); thigh skin (average, maximum and minimum) and \nrectal temperature (n=10) were recorded before and 60 min after treatment. The \ngreatest reduction (P<0.05) in muscle (mean \u00b1 SD; 1 cm: WBC, 1.6 \u00b1 1.2\u00b0C; CWI, \n2.0 \u00b1 1.0\u00b0C; 2 cm: WBC, 1.2 \u00b1 0.7\u00b0C; CWI, 1.7 \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C; 3 cm: WBC, 1.6 \u00b1 0.6\u00b0C; \nCWI, 1.7 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) and rectal temperature (WBC, 0.3 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C; CWI, 0.4 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C) \nwere observed 60 min after treatment. The largest reductions in average (WBC, \n12.1 \u00b1 1.0\u00b0C; CWI, 8.4 \u00b1 0.7\u00b0C), minimum (WBC, 13.2 \u00b1 1.4\u00b0C; CWI, 8.7 \u00b1 0.7\u00b0C) \nand maximum (WBC, 8.8 \u00b1 2.0\u00b0C; CWI, 7.2 \u00b1 1.9\u00b0C) skin temperature occurred \nimmediately after both CWI and WBC (P<0.05). Skin temperature was significantly \nlower (P<0.05) immediately after WBC compared to CWI. The present study \ndemonstrates that a single WBC exposure decreases muscle and core temperature to \na similar level of those experienced after CWI. Although both treatments \nsignificantly reduced skin temperature, WBC elicited a greater decrease compared \nto CWI. These data may provide information to clinicians and researchers \nattempting to optimise WBC and CWI protocols in a clinical or sporting setting.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pone.0048190\nPMCID: PMC3491015\nPMID: 23139763 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interests exist.",

Eight men (age 23 \u00b1 3 years; \nstature 190.5 \u00b1 8.9 cm; body mass 90.3 \u00b1 9.6 kg; body fat 12.8 \u00b1 4.8%) and eight \nwomen (age 22 \u00b1 2 years; stature 179.0 \u00b1 8.5 cm; body mass 77.6 \u00b1 9.2 kg; body \nfat 22.5 \u00b1 6.6%) basketball players participated. Massage, cold-water immersion \nor control were applied immediately after competitive matches, followed by \nassessments of perceptual measures of recovery and physical performance, \ncountermovement jump and repeated-sprint ability 24 h after intervention. There \nwas lower perception of fatigue overall and in the legs immediately after the \nmassage and cold-water immersion condition (P < 0.001; \u03b7\u00b2(P) = 0.91). \nFurthermore, women had a lower perception of fatigue in cold-water immersion \nthan massage at any testing time (P < 0.001; \u03b7\u00b2(P) = 0.37). Jump performance was \ngreater after cold-water immersion than the control condition (P = 0.037, \u03b7\u00b2(P) \n= 0.37). There was no effect of any of the recovery interventions on \nrepeated-sprint measures (P at best 0.067, \u03b7\u00b2(P) at best 0.68). The results \nsuggest that both massage and cold-water immersion improve perceptual measures \nof recovery. Furthermore, cold-water immersion improves jump performance \nalthough neither such immersion nor massage had an effect on repeated-sprint \nability.

Nine well-trained male cyclists \nperformed 2 successive bouts of 45 min of endurance cycling exercise in a \ntemperate environment (20 \u00b0C) separated by 25 min of the respective recovery \ninterventions. Capillary blood samples were obtained to measure lactate (La\u207b), \nsodium (Na\u207a), bicarbonate (HCO\u2083\u207b) concentrations and pH, whilst body mass loss \n(BML), core temperature (T(core)), skin temperature (T(skin)), heart rate (HR), \noxygen uptake , and minute ventilation were measured before (Pre), immediately \nafter the first exercise bout (Ex1), the recovery (R), and after the second \nexercise bout (Ex2).

In this research, we evaluated hydrotherapy for \nrecovery from a simulated game of rugby union tracked over a week of training. \nTwenty-four experienced male rugby union players (mean \u00b1 SD age 19.46 \u00b1 0.82 \nyears, weight 82.38 \u00b1 11.12 kg, height 178.54 \u00b1 5.75 cm) were randomly divided \ninto 3 groups: cold water immersion (n = 8), contrast bath therapy (n = 8), and \na control group (n = 8). The 2 forms of hydrotherapy were administered \nimmediately after a simulated rugby game. Testing was conducted 1 hour before \nthe game and at 5 intervals postgame: 1, 48, 72, 96, and 144 hours. Dependent \nvariables included countermovement jump, 10- and 40-m sprints, sessional rating \nof perceived exertion (RPE), flexibility, thigh circumference, and self-reported \ndelayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Significant differences in DOMS were found \nbetween the cold water immersion and contrast bath groups at 48 hours post \nintervention (p = 0.02), and between the control and contrast bath groups at 72 \n(p = 0.03) and 96 (p = 0.04) hours post intervention. Cold water immersion and \ncontrast bath groups reported significantly different RPE at 72 hours (p = ?) \nand 96 hours post (p = 0.05) intervention. Athletes' perceptions of muscle \nsoreness and sessional RPE scores for training were greater in the contrast bath \ngroup (20%) after the simulated game and throughout the training week. Although \nresults from passive and power tests were inconclusive in determining whether \ncold water immersion or passive recovery was more effective in attenuating \nfatigue, results indicated contrast baths had little benefit in enhancing \nrecovery during a cyclic week of rugby union.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0b013e318260ed9b\nPMID: 22796996 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Players were required to choose from a number of recovery modalities \navailable immediately post-game. These included floor stretching, pool \nstretching, bike active recovery, pool active recovery, cold-water immersion, \ncontrast therapy and use of a compression garment. Perceptual measures of \nrecovery were recorded throughout the week and a test of physical performance \nwas conducted two days post-game. Game performance ratings were also recorded. \nThe associations between the post-game recovery protocols chosen and players' \nperceived recovery, and physical and game performances were determined by the \nassociation rule data-mining strategy.\nRESULTS: Statistically significant associations were found between a number of \npost-game recovery protocols and perceptual recovery. In general, players who \nchose cold-water immersion, floor stretching, no active recovery (neither bike \nor pool) and the use of a compression garment post-game, had an increased \nprobability of reporting greater perceptual recovery across the following week, \nrelative to all other permutations of recovery protocols chosen. There were no \nassociations found between post-game recovery protocol combinations and physical \nrecovery. No associations were found between the post-game recovery methods and \nthe next game performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Perceptual recovery among players was enhanced through the \nselection of specific combinations of recovery protocols post game. However, no \nlinks were found between recovery protocols and physical or game performance \nmeasures.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

On the first visit, an incremental \ntest was performed to determine maximal oxygen consumption and the associated \nspeed (MAS). The remaining 3 visits for the performance of constant velocity \nexhaustive tests at MAS and different recovery methods (6 min) were separated by \n7-day intervals [randomized: CWI, AR or passive recovery (PR)]. The CWI and AR \nlowered [Lac] (p<0.05) at 11, 13 and 15 min after exercise cessation in \ncomparison to PR. There was a 'time' and 'recovery mode' interaction for 2 HRV \nindices: standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) (partial eta \nsquared=0.114) and natural log of low-frequency power density (lnLF) (partial \neta squared=0.090). CWI presented significantly higher SDNN compared to PR at 15 \nmin of recovery (p<0.05). In addition, greater SDNN values were found in CWI vs. \nAR during the application of recovery interventions, and at 30 and 75 min \npost-exercise (p<0.05 for all differences). The lnLF during the recovery \ninterventions and at 75 min post-exercise was greater using CWI compared with AR \n(p<0.05). For square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences \nbetween adjacent R-R intervals (RMSSD) and natural log of high-frequency power \ndensity (lnHF), a moderate effect size was found between CWI and PR during the \nrecovery interventions and at 15 min post-exercise. Our findings show that AR \nand CWI offer benefits regarding the removal of [Lac] following high-intensity \nexercise. While limited, CWI results in some improvement in post-exercise \ncardiac autonomic regulation compared to AR and PR. Further, AR is not \nrecommended if the aim is to accelerate the parasympathetic reactivation.\n\n\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York.\n\nDOI: 10.1055\/s-0032-1301905\nPMID: 22722961 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After \nweek 1 training, all players completed a passive recovery (PAS). During week 2, \nCOLD or CWT was randomly assigned. Players undertook the opposing intervention \nin week 3. Repeat-sprint ability (6 \u00d7 20 m), countermovement and squat jumps, \nperceived muscle soreness, and fatigue were measured pretraining and over 48 h \nposttraining.\nRESULTS: Immediately posttraining, groups exhibited similar performance and \npsychometric declines. At 24 h, repeat-sprint time had deteriorated by 4.1% for \nPAS and 1.0% for CWT but was fully restored by COLD (0.0%). At 24 and 48 h, both \nCOLD and CWT attenuated changes in mean muscle soreness, with COLD (0.6 \u00b1 0.6 \nand 0.0 \u00b1 0.4) more effective than CWT (1.9 \u00b1 0.7 and 1.0 \u00b1 0.7) and PAS having \nminimal effect (5.5 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.0 \u00b1 0.5). Similarly, after 24 and 48 h, COLD and \nCWT both effectively reduced changes in perceived fatigue, with COLD (0.6 \u00b1 0.6 \nand 0.0 \u00b1 0.6) being more successful than CWT (0.8 \u00b1 0.6 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.6) and PAS \nhaving the smallest effect (2.2 \u00b1 0.8 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.6).\nCONCLUSIONS: AF training can result in prolonged physical and psychometric \ndeficits persisting for up to 48 h. For restoring physical-performance and \npsychometric measures, COLD was more effective than CWT, with PAS being the \nleast effective. Based on these results the authors recommend that 14 min of \nCOLD be used after AF training.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.7.4.357\nPMID: 22645174 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Such unloading causes atrophy \npredominantly of the postural muscles, especially those of the lower limbs.\nMETHODS: We tested the hypothesis that 35 d horizontal bed rest alters \nthermoregulatory responses of subjects (N = 10) immersed in 15 degrees C water, \nparticularly the heat produced by the shivering tremor of the skeletal muscles. \nBefore and after bed rest we measured the thickness of the gastrocnemius \nmedialis (GM), vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA), and biceps brachii \n(BB) muscles by ultrasonography. During the immersions, we monitored rectal and \nskin temperatures, heat flux, heart rate, and oxygen uptake.\nRESULTS: After bed rest, muscle thickness decreased significantly by 12.2 +\/- \n8.8% and 8.0 +\/- 9.1% in the GM and VL, respectively. No changes were observed \nin the TA and BB muscles. The 35-d bed rest caused a significant reduction in \naerobic power, as reflected in maximal oxygen uptake. There were no significant \ndifferences in any of the observed thermoregulatory responses between the pre- \nand post-bed rest immersions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning had no effect on the \nheat production and heat loss responses. Due to the significant reduction in the \nmass of the muscles in the lower limbs, concomitant with no change in heat \nproduction, we conclude that leg muscles do not play a significant role in \nshivering thermogenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.3357\/asem.3040.2012\nPMID: 22606862 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-two \nhealthy Division I collegiate soccer players (13 men and 9 women; age, 19.8 \u00b1 \n1.1 years; height, 174.0 \u00b1 9.0 cm; mass, 72.1 \u00b1 9.1 kg) volunteered as \nparticipants during the noncompetitive season. The YIRT was used to induce \nvolitional fatigue and was administered at baseline and again 48 hours later. \nAthletes progressively increased sprint speed between markers set 20 m apart \nuntil pace was failed. Countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) was used to assess \nanaerobic power and was measured before YIRT, immediately post-YIRT, and 24 and \n48 hours post-YIRT. A 10-cm horizontal visual analog scale was administered \nimmediately, 24 hours and 48 hours post-YIRT to assess perceived fatigue (PF) in \nthe legs. Participants were randomly placed into the CWI or control group. The \nCWI condition consisted of immersion to the umbilicus in a 12\u00b0C pool for 15 \nminutes, whereas the control group sat quietly for 15 minutes. There were no \nsignificant differences between intervention conditions on YIRT performance \n(control, 4,900 \u00b1 884 m; CWI, 5,288 \u00b1 1,000 m; p = 0.35) or PF (control, 9.4 \u00b1 \n0.5 cm; CWI, 9.3 \u00b1 0.6 cm; p = 0.65) at 48 hours post-YIRT. There was a main \ntime effect for CMVJ over 48 hours, but no group differences (pre-YIRT, 64.6 \u00b1 \n11.0 cm; post-YIRT, 66.4 \u00b1 10.9 cm; 24 hours post-YIRT, 63.4 \u00b1 9.9 cm; 48 hours \npost-YIRT, 63.1 \u00b1 9.4 cm; p = 0.02). This study demonstrated that in collegiate \nsoccer players, CWI performed immediately and 24 hours after induced volitional \nfatigue did not affect subsequent physical performance estimates.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0b013e318239c3a1\nPMID: 21986695 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The NCV of sural (sensory) and posterior \ntibial (motor) nerves was evaluated. Initial (pre-cooling) and final (30 min \npost-cooling) NCV were compared using a paired t-test. The effects of the \nmodalities and the post-cooling activities on NCV were evaluated by an analysis \nof covariance.

The \npurpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cooling methods on \ncore body temperature, heart rate (HR), and perceptual readings in individuals \nafter exercise. Sixteen subjects (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, height: 182 \u00b1 7 cm, weight: \n74.03 \u00b1 9.17 kg, and body fat: 17.08 \u00b1 6.23%) completed 10 exercise sessions in \nwarm conditions (WBGT: 26.64 \u00b1 4.71\u00b0C) followed by body cooling by 10 different \nmethods. Cooling methods included cold water immersion (CWI), shade, \nPort-a-Cool\u00ae (FAN), Emergency Cold Containment System\u00ae (ECCS), Rehab. Hood\u00ae \n(HOOD), Game Ready Active Cooling Vest\u2122 (GRV), Nike Ice Vest\u2122 (NIV), ice buckets \n(IBs), and ice towels (IT). These cooling modes were compared with a control \n(SUN). Rectal temperature (T(re)), HR, thermal sensation, thirst sensation, and \na 56-question Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ) were used to assess \nphysiological and perceptual data. Average T(re) after exercise across all \ntrials was 38.73 \u00b1 0.12\u00b0C. After 10 minutes of cooling, CWI (-0.65 \u00b1 0.29\u00b0C), \nECCS (-0.68 \u00b1 0.24\u00b0C), and IB (-0.74 \u00b1 0.34\u00b0C) had significantly (p < 0.006) \ngreater decreases in T(re) compared with that in SUN (-0.42 \u00b1 0.15\u00b0C). The HR \nafter 10 minutes of cooling was significantly (p < 0.006) lower for CWI (82 \u00b1 15 \nb\u00b7min(-1)), ECCS (87 \u00b1 14 b\u00b7min(-1)), and IT (84 \u00b1 15 b\u00b7min(-1)) when compared \nwith SUN (101 \u00b1 15 b\u00b7min(-1)). The thermal sensation between modalities was all \nsignificantly (p < 0.006) lower (CWI: 1.5 \u00b1 0.5; Fan: 3.0 \u00b1 1.0; ECCS: 4.5 \u00b1 \n1.0; Hood: 4.5 \u00b1 0.5; GRV: 4.0 \u00b1 0.5; NIV: 4.5 \u00b1 1.0; IB: 4.0 \u00b1 1.0; IT: 3.0 \u00b1 \n1.0) when compared with SUN (5.5 \u00b1 0.5), except for Shade (5.0 \u00b1 1.0). There \nwere no significant differences (p > 0.006) in thirst sensation between \nmodalities. The ESQ scores were significantly (p < 0.006) lower for CWI (1 \u00b1 6), \nFan (4 \u00b1 5), and IT (3 \u00b1 8) compared with that for SUN (13 \u00b1 12). In conclusion, \nwhen athletes experience mild hyperthermia, CWI, ECCS, and IB resulted in a \nsignificantly greater decrease in T(re). These cooling strategies are \nrecommended to decrease T(re) during a brief recovery period between exercise \nbouts.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0b013e3182259b1d\nPMID: 21760549 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The ISE consisted of a 15-m \nsprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and \nwalking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants \nperformed 5 \u00d7 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on \neach effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with \nvoluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function \n(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of \nperceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for \nmetabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, \nimmediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.\nRESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in \nCONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI \nresulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). \nM-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and \n2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05).

On three \noccasions, 18 well-trained cyclists completed 60 min high-intensity cycling, \nfollowed 20 min later by one of three 10-min recovery interventions: passive \nrest (PAS), cold water immersion (CWI), or contrast water immersion (CWT). The \ncyclists then rested quietly for 160 min with R-R intervals and perceptions of \nrecovery recorded every 30 min. Cardiac parasympathetic activity was evaluated \nusing the natural logarithm of the square root of mean squared differences of \nsuccessive R-R intervals (ln rMSSD). Finally, the cyclists completed a \nwork-based cycling time trial. Effects were examined using magnitude-based \ninferences. Differences in time-trial performance between the three trials were \ntrivial. Compared with PAS, general fatigue was very likely lower for CWI \n(difference [90% confidence limits; -12% (-18; -5)]) and CWT [-11% (-19; -2)]. \nLeg soreness was almost certainly lower following CWI [-22% (-30; -14)] and CWT \n[-27% (-37; -15)]. The change in mean ln rMSSD following the recovery \ninterventions (ln rMSSD(Post-interv)) was almost certainly higher following CWI \n[16.0% (10.4; 23.2)] and very likely higher following CWT [12.5% (5.5; 20.0)] \ncompared with PAS, and possibly higher following CWI [3.7% (-0.9; 8.4)] compared \nwith CWT. The correlations between performance, ln rMSSD(Post-interv) and \nperceptions of recovery were unclear. A moderate correlation was observed \nbetween ln rMSSD(Post-interv) and leg soreness [r = -0.50 (-0.66; -0.29)]. \nAlthough the effects of CWI and CWT on performance were trivial, the beneficial \neffects on perceptions of recovery support the use of these recovery strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-011-2052-7\nPMID: 21710292 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twelve subjects had two microdialysis \nfibres placed in the ventral forearm and were immersed to the sternum in a \nbathtub on parallel study days (normoxia and poikilocapnic hypoxia with an \narterial O(2) saturation of 80%). One fibre served as the control (1 mM \npropranolol) and the other received 5 mM yohimbine (plus 1 mM propranolol) to \nblock adrenergic receptors. Skin blood flow was assessed at each site (laser \nDoppler flowmetry), divided by mean arterial pressure to calculate cutaneous \nvascular conductance (CVC), and scaled to baseline. Cold exposure was first \ninduced by a progressive reduction in water temperature from 36 to 23\u00b0C over 30 \nmin to assess cutaneous vascular regulation, then by clamping the water \ntemperature at 10\u00b0C for 45 min to test defense of core temperature. During \nnormoxia, cold stress reduced CVC in control (-44 \u00b1 4%) and yohimbine sites (-13 \n\u00b1 7%; both P < 0.05 versus precooling). Hypoxia caused vasodilatation prior to \ncooling but resulted in greater reductions in CVC in control (-67 \u00b1 7%) and \nyohimbine sites (-35 \u00b1 11%) during cooling (both P < 0.05 versus precooling; \nboth P < 0.05 versus normoxia). Core cooling rate during the second phase of \ncold exposure was unaffected by hypoxia (-1.81 \u00b1 0.23\u00b0C h(-1) in normoxia versus \n-1.97 \u00b1 0.33\u00b0C h(-1) in hypoxia; P > 0.05). We conclude that hypoxia increases \ncutaneous (non-noradrenergic) vasoconstriction during prolonged cold exposure, \nwhile core cooling rate is not consistently affected.\n\nDOI: 10.1113\/expphysiol.2011.059147\nPMID: 21705404 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

It has been thought that the temperature of repeated \ncold exposures during the adaptation period is one of the factors affecting the \ntype of cold adaptation developed. This study tested the hypothesis that \nrepeated mild cold immersions would induce an insulative cold adaptation but \nwould not alter the metabolic response. Seven healthy male participants were \nimmersed to their xiphoid process level repeatedly in 26\u00b0C water for 60 min, 3 \ndays every week, for 4 weeks. During the first and last exposure of this cold \nacclimation period, the participants underwent body immersion tests measuring \ntheir thermoregulatory responses to cold. Separately, they conducted finger \nimmersion into 5\u00b0C water for 30 min to assess their cold-induced vasodilation \n(CIVD) response before and after cold acclimation. During the immersion to \nxiphoid process, participants showed significantly lower mean skin temperature \nand skin blood flow in the forearm post-acclimation, while no adaptation was \nobserved in the metabolic response. Additionally, blunted CIVD responses were \nobserved after cold acclimation. From these results, it was considered that the \nparticipants showed an insulative-type of cold acclimation after the repeated \nmild cold immersions. The major finding of this study was the acceptance of the \nhypothesis that repeated mild cold immersion was sufficient to induce insulative \ncold adaptation but did not alter the metabolic response. It is suggested that \nthe adaptation in the thermoregulatory response is specific to the response \nwhich is repeatedly stimulated during the adaptation process.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00484-011-0462-1\nPMID: 21695574 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Egana, Mikel [corrected to Ega\u00f1a, \nMikel].\n\nPURPOSE: Given the widespread use of water immersion during recovery from \nexercise, we aimed to investigate the effect of contrast water immersion on \nrecovery of sprint cycling performance, HR and, blood lactate.\nMETHODS: Two groups completed high-intensity sprint exercise before and after a \n30-min randomized recovery. The Wingate group (n = 8) performed 3 \u00d7 30-s Wingate \ntests (4-min rest periods). The repeated intermittent sprint group (n = 8) \ncycled for alternating 30-s periods at 40% of predetermined maximum power and \n120% maximum power, until exhaustion. Both groups completed three trials using a \ndifferent recovery treatment for each trial (balanced randomized application). \nRecovery treatments were passive rest, 1:1 contrast water immersion (2.5 min of \ncold (8\u00b0C) to 2.5 min of hot (40\u00b0C)), and 1:4 contrast water immersion (1 min of \ncold to 4 min of hot). Blood lactate and HR were recorded throughout, and peak \npower and total work for pre- and postrecovery Wingate performance and exercise \ntime and total work for repeated sprinting were recorded.\nRESULTS: Recovery of Wingate peak power was 8% greater after 1:4 contrast water \nimmersion than after passive rest, whereas both contrast water immersion ratios \nprovided a greater recovery of exercise time (\u223c 10%) and total work (\u223c 14%) for \nrepeated sprinting than for passive rest. Blood lactate was similar between \ntrials. Compared with passive rest, HR initially declined more slowly during \ncontrast water immersion but increased with each transition to a cold immersion \nphase.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data support contrast water immersion being effective in \nmaintaining performance during a short-term recovery from sprint exercise. This \neffect needs further investigation but is likely explained by cardiovascular \nmechanisms, shown here by an elevation in HR upon each cold immersion.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e31821d06d9\nPMID: 21502898 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Fifteen \npre- (age 12.8 \u00b1 0.6 years) and 13 post- (15.9 \u00b1 1 y) peak height velocity (PHV) \nplayers played two matches (Matches 1 and 2) within 48 h against the same \nopposition, with no specific between-match recovery intervention (control). Five \npost-PHV players also completed another set of two consecutive matches, with spa \ntreatment implemented after the first match. Match running performance was \nassessed using a global positioning system with very-high-intensity running (> \n16.1-19.0 km \u00b7 h(-1)), sprinting distance (>19 km \u00b7 h(-1)), and peak match speed \ndetermined. Match 2 very-high-intensity running was \"possibly\" impaired in \npost-PHV players (-9 \u00b1 33%; \u00b1 90% confidence limits), whereas it was \"very \nlikely\" improved for the pre-PHV players (+27 \u00b1 22%). The spa treatment had a \nbeneficial impact on Match 2 running performance, with a \"likely\" rating for \nsprinting distance (+30 \u00b1 67%) and \"almost certain\" for peak match speed (+6.4 \u00b1 \n3%).

Twenty-male soccer players completed one match and \nwere randomly divided into cryotherapy (10 min cold water immersion, 10\u00b0C, n = \n10) and thermoneutral (10 min thermoneutral water immersion, 35\u00b0C, n = 10) \ngroups. Muscle damage (creatine kinase, myoglobin), inflammation (C-reactive \nprotein), neuromuscular function (jump and sprint abilities and maximal \nisometric quadriceps strength), and delayed-onset muscle soreness were evaluated \nbefore, within 30 min of the end, and 24 and 48 h after the match. After the \nmatch, the players in both groups showed increased plasma creatine kinase \nactivity (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 min) and C-reactive protein (30 \nmin, 24 h) concentrations. Peak jump ability and maximal strength were decreased \nand delayed-onset muscle soreness increased in both groups. However, \ndifferential alterations were observed between thermoneutral water and cold \nwater immersion groups in creatine kinase (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 \nmin), C-reactive protein (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), quadriceps strength (24 h), and \nquadriceps (24 h), calf (24 h) and adductor (30 min) delayed-onset muscle \nsoreness. The results suggest that cold water immersion immediately after a \none-off soccer match reduces muscle damage and discomfort, possibly contributing \nto a faster recovery of neuromuscular function.\n\nDOI: 10.1080\/02640414.2010.526132\nPMID: 21170794 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The recovery intervention consisted of different water \nimmersion techniques, including: temperate water immersion (36\u00b0C; TWI), cold \nwater immersion (10\u00b0C; CWI), contrast water temperature (10-42\u00b0C; CWT) and a \npassive recovery (PAS). Performances during a maximal 30-s rowing test (P(30 \ns)), a maximal vertical counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a maximal isometric \nvoluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor muscles were measured at rest \n(Pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (Post-exercise), 1 h after (Post \n1 h) and 24 h later (Post 24 h). Leukocyte profile and venous blood markers of \nmuscle damage (creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were also \nmeasured Pre-exercise, Post 1 h and Post 24 h. A significant time effect was \nobserved to indicate a reduction in performance (Pre-exercise vs. Post-exercise) \nfollowing the exercise bout in all conditions (P < 0.05). Indeed, at 1 h post \nexercise, a significant improvement in MVC and P(30 s) was respectively observed \nin the CWI and CWT groups compared to pre-exercise. Further, for the CWI group, \nthis result was associated with a comparative blunting of the rise in total \nnumber of leucocytes at 1 h post and of plasma concentration of CK at 24 h post. \nThe results indicate that the practice of cold water immersion and contrast \nwater therapy are more effective immersion modalities to promote a faster acute \nrecovery of maximal anaerobic performances (MVC and 30\u2033 all-out respectively) \nafter an intermittent exhaustive exercise. These results may be explained by the \nsuppression of plasma concentrations of markers of inflammation and damage, \nsuggesting reduced passive leakage from disrupted skeletal muscle, which may \nresult in the increase in force production during ensuing bouts of exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-010-1754-6\nPMID: 21132438 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In the present study we compared the \nshort-term effects of cold water immersion therapy (CWIT) and light emitting \ndiode therapy (LEDT) with placebo LEDT on biochemical markers related to \nskeletal muscle recovery after high-intensity exercise. A randomized \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed with six male \nyoung futsal athletes. They were treated with CWIT (5\u00b0C of temperature [SD \n\u00b11\u00b0]), active LEDT (69 LEDs with wavelengths 660\/850\u00a0nm, 10\/30\u00a0mW of output \npower, 30 s of irradiation time per point, and 41.7\u00a0J of total energy irradiated \nper point, total of ten points irradiated) or an identical placebo LEDT 5\u00a0min \nafter each of three Wingate cycle tests. Pre-exercise, post-exercise, and \npost-treatment measurements were taken of blood lactate levels, creatine kinase \n(CK) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. There were no significant \ndifferences in the work performed during the three Wingate tests (p\u2009>\u20090.05). All \nbiochemical parameters increased from baseline values (p\u2009<\u20090.05) after the three \nexercise tests, but only active LEDT decreased blood lactate levels (p\u2009=\u20090.0065) \nand CK activity (p\u2009=\u20090.0044) significantly after treatment. There were no \nsignificant differences in CRP values after treatments. We concluded that \ntreating the leg muscles with LEDT 5\u00a0min after the Wingate cycle test seemed to \ninhibit the expected post-exercise increase in blood lactate levels and CK \nactivity. This suggests that LEDT has better potential than 5\u00a0min of CWIT for \nimproving short-term post-exercise recovery.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s10103-010-0866-x\nPMCID: PMC3119799\nPMID: 21088862 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts \nof interest.",

Nine physically active men, who were either current or ex-National \nCollegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 athletes, consented to \nparticipate in the study.

Two sets of 3 maximal \neffort CMVJs were performed on a force plate at each testing time point. For \neach protocol, the subjects completed a pretest set of CMVJ (pretreatment \n[PRE]), were then exposed to 1 of the 2 temperature treatments, completed \nanother set of CMVJ (initial [IT]), then either went through a 15-minute \nwarm-up, or were asked to sit in place.

However, concerns exist over potential overcooling of \nhyperthermic individuals during cold-water immersion.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the recommendation that removing previously hyperthermic \nindividuals from a cold-water bath at a rectal temperature (T(re)) of 38.6\u00b0C \nwould attenuate overcooling.\nDESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.\nSETTING: University research laboratory.\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 6 men and 4 women (age \u200a=\u200a \n22 \u00b1 3 years, height \u200a=\u200a 172 \u00b1 10 cm, mass \u200a=\u200a 67.8 \u00b1 10.7 kg, body fat \npercentage \u200a=\u200a 17.1% \u00b1 4.5%, maximum oxygen consumption \u200a=\u200a 59.3 \u00b1 8.7 \nmL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)).\nINTERVENTION(S): After exercising at an ambient temperature of 40.0\u00b0C for 38.5 \u00b1 \n9.4 minutes, until T(re) reached 39.5\u00b0C, participants were immersed in a 2.0\u00b0C \ncirculated water bath until T(re) decreased to either 37.5\u00b0C or 38.6\u00b0C. \nSubsequently, participants were removed from the water bath and recovered for 20 \nminutes at an ambient temperature of 25\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rectal and esophageal temperatures were measured \ncontinuously during the immersion and recovery periods.\nRESULTS: Because of the experimental design, the overall time of immersion was \ngreater during the 37.5\u00b0C trial (16.6 \u00b1 5.7 minutes) than the 38.6\u00b0C trial (8.8 \n\u00b1 2.6 minutes) (t(9) \u200a=\u200a -4.740, P \u200a=\u200a .001).

In addition, cold water \nimmersion (CWI) itself has been shown to reduce the concentration of the hormone \nleptin, high concentrations of which signal satiety. Taken together, these \nfindings raise the question of whether the common practice of postexercise CWI \nby athletes acutely affects energy intake. Hence, this study investigated the \nacute effect of CWI after exercise on subsequent energy intake and macronutrient \npreferences as well as the circulating levels of a range of appetite-related \nhormones.\nMETHODS: Ten physically active men participated in three randomized, \ncounterbalanced trials consisting of 40 min of treadmill running (70% \nVO(2peak)), followed by 20 min of CWI (15\u00b0C), neutral water immersion (NWI; \n33\u00b0C), or a resting control with no immersion (CON). Participants were then \ngiven a 30-min access to a buffet-type breakfast of precisely known quantity and \nnutrient composition from which they could consume ad libitum.\nRESULTS: Participants consumed significantly more energy after both CWI (mean \u00b1 \nSD = 4893 \u00b1 1554 kJ, P = 0.006) and NWI (5167 \u00b1 1975 kJ, P = 0.010) compared \nwith CON (4089 \u00b1 1585 kJ). However, there was no significant difference in total \nenergy intake between the CWI and the NWI trials (P = 0.595). These changes were \nassociated with a significant interaction effect of time and trial on both \nleptin (P = 0.045) and active ghrelin (P = 0.046).\nCONCLUSION: Postexercise water immersion is associated with higher energy intake \nin the subsequent meal compared with CON. This is an important consideration for \ntrained men using water immersion as a method of recovery from exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e3181f55d2e\nPMID: 20798665 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Ten subjects completed \ntwo testing sessions separated by 1 week; each trial consisted of an initial \nall-out 35-min exercise bout, one of two 15-min recovery interventions \n(randomised: CWI or ACT), followed by a 40-min passive recovery period before \nrepeating the 35-min exercise bout.

However, few studies have compared the effect of \ndifferent cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice \nmassage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural \n(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.\nDESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were \nrandomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent \nvariables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. \nDependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) \nyears, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold \nmodalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature \nand nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after \ncooling.\nRESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There \nalso was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the \ncompound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion \nreduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m\/s and \nmotor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m\/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the \nmost effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.\nLIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than \nthat of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment \ngroup. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.\nCONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and \nchanging sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to \ninduce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as \napplied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic \neffects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.\n\nDOI: 10.2522\/ptj.20090131\nPMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Ten \nwell-trained swimmers (5 males, 5 females; 19.0 +\/- 3.9 years) performed two \n100-m swimming sprints (S1 and S2) interspersed with a 30-min passive recovery \nperiod, during which athletes were randomly assigned to 5 min of CWI (14 degrees \nC) or an out-of-water control condition (CON 28 degrees C).

CWI was associated with a 'likely' decrease in swimming \nperformance [1.8% (90% CI 0.2, 3.5)], as well as 'likely' lower peak HR [-1.9% \n(-3.6, -0.2)]. CWI was also associated with a 'likely' smaller decrease in Ln \nrMSSD after the first sprint [-16.7% (-30.9, -4.1)]. RPR was 'likely' better \n[+27.2% (-3.7, 68.0)] following CWI. 'unclear' effects were observed for \n[La](ac) [+24.7% (-13.4, 79.5)], [La](cle) [-7.6% (-24.2, 12.7)] or RPE [+2.0% \n(-12.3, 18.5)]. Following CWI, changes in sprint times were 'largely' correlated \nwith changes in peak HR (r = 0.80). Despite a subjective perception of improved \nrecovery following CWI, this recovery intervention resulted in slower swimming \ntimes in well-trained athletes swimming in simulated competition conditions.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-010-1381-2\nPMID: 20162301 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

C(T)WT demonstrated a significant reduction (p = 0.04) in \nlactate post-intervention compared to ACT recovery.

On separate days, 28 \nyoung (age: 14.3 +\/- 0.7 years) soccer players played 3 soccer matches each \nrandomly followed by 1 of 3 recovery modalities: (a) CONT-cold (12 degrees C) \nwater immersion and hot (38 degrees C) shower, (b) COMB-cold water immersion and \nactive recovery using a cycle ergometer, and (c) PASS-a passive post-match \nroutine (stretching and leg raise). Performance (vertical jump height), \nphysiological (heart rate and tympanic temperature), and perceptual measures \n(perceived quality of recovery) were determined before each match, 10 minutes \nafter each match, after each recovery method, and after 24 hours. There was a \n0.6 +\/- 6.7% drop in immediately after a match, but there was no difference in \nvertical jump height after 24 hours (p = 0.997). Perceived quality of recovery \nimmediately after COMB was substantially higher than CONT and PASS, but the \neffect did not last more than 24 hours. The players perceived lighter legs after \nCOMB, compared with the PASS, at post-24 hours. In conclusion, a combined \nrecovery modality (cold water immersion and active recovery) after a soccer \nmatch did not have a substantial effect on vertical jump height performance when \ncompared with contrast water immersion and passive recovery alone. However, the \nobserved positive effects on perceived recovery (higher quality of recovery and \nlighter legs) after the combined modality (cold water immersion and active \nrecovery) suggest that this approach may be effective for young players after \nintense soccer match play.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0b013e3181a0226a\nPMID: 19620926 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

On each occasion, they had to perform two climbing tests (C1 \nand C2) until volitional exhaustion on a prepracticed route (overhanging wall, \nlevel 6b). These two tests were separated by 20 min of recovery. Four recovery \nmethods were used in randomized order: passive recovery, active recovery (cycle \nergometer, 30-40 W), electromyostimulation on the forearm muscles (bisymmetric \nTENS current), or cold water immersion of the forearms and arms (three periods \nof 5 min at 15 +\/- 1 degrees C). Climbing tests' performance was reflected by \nthe number of arm movements and climb duration.\nRESULTS: Using active recovery and cold water immersion, performance at C2 was \nmaintained in comparison with C1, whereas C2 performance was impaired compared \nwith C1 (P< 0.01) using electromyostimulation and passive recovery (recovery \nmethod-by-climb interaction, P < 0.05). Blood lactate decreased during recovery, \nwith the greatest decrease occurring during active recovery (time-by-recovery \nmethod interaction, P < 0.001). Arms and forearms' skin temperatures were lower \nthroughout the cold water immersion compared with the other three methods (P < \n0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Active recovery and cold water immersion are two means of preserving \nperformance when repeating acute exhausting climbing trails in female climbers. \nThese positive effects are accompanied by a greater lactate removal and a \ndecrease in subcutaneous tissues temperatures, respectively.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e318195107d\nPMID: 19461534 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We also correlated body mass index (BMI) with PPT and PTOL in \nyoung women.\nMETHODS: This was a self-controlled study carried out on 79 second-year female \nmedical students in the Department of Physiology, King Faisal University, \nDammam, Saudi Arabia during the year 2007. The students were assessed before, \nand after they were subjected to a mental (exam), and 2 physical stressors. \nMeasurements of PPT and PTOL were carried out using a pressure algometer. The 2 \nphysical stressors used were: cold water immersion and isometric exercise (ISO \nEX) with a dynamometer. Students' body mass indices were measured in addition to \nthe measurement of blood pressure and heart rate for each student before, and \nafter exposure to the stressors.\nRESULTS: All 3 stressors significantly increased the PPT values (p=0.000). The \nPTOL was also significantly increased immediately after exposure to the physical \nstressors (p=0.000), while for the mental stressor, the PTOL readings were not \nsignificantly increased. Among the 3 types of stressors, the cold water \nimmersion was the most effective in increasing PPT and PTOL.

Although ice-cold-water immersion will rapidly extract heat, access to \nice or cold water may be limited in hot climates. Indeed, some have concerns \nregarding the sudden cold-water immersion of hyperthermic individuals, whereas \nothers believe that cutaneous vasoconstriction may reduce convective heat \ntransfer from the core. It was hypothesized that warmer immersion temperatures, \nwhich induce less powerful vasoconstriction, may still facilitate rapid cooling \nin hyperthermic individuals.\nMETHODS: Eight males participated in three trials and were heated to an \nesophageal temperature of 39.5 degrees C by exercising in the heat (36 degrees \nC, 50% relative humidity) while wearing a water-perfusion garment (40 degrees \nC). Subjects were cooled using each of the following methods: air (20-22 degrees \nC), cold-water immersion (14 degrees C), and temperate-water immersion (26 \ndegrees C).\nRESULTS: The time to reach an esophageal temperature of 37.5 degrees C averaged \n22.81 min (air), 2.16 min (cold), and 2.91 min (temperate). Whereas each of the \nbetween-trial comparisons was statistically significant (P < 0.05), cooling in \ntemperate water took only marginally longer than that in cold water, and one \ncannot imagine that the 45-s cooling time difference would have any meaningful \nphysiological or clinical implications.\nCONCLUSION: It is assumed that this rapid heat loss was due to a less powerful \nperipheral vasoconstrictor response, with central heat being more rapidly \ntransported to the skin surface for dissipation. Although the core-to-water \nthermal gradient was much smaller with temperate-water cooling, greater skin and \ndeeper tissue blood flows would support a superior convective heat delivery. \nThus, a sustained physiological mechanism (blood flow) appears to have countered \na less powerful thermal gradient, resulting in clinically insignificant \ndifferences in heat extraction between the cold and temperate cooling trials.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e31817eee9d\nPMID: 18845977 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The use of the parameter mean sphered cell volume \n(MSCV), automatically measured by means of the Coulter LH750, could be useful \nfor diagnosing the presence of sport hemolysis. We studied the behavior of MSCV \nand mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in 30 top-level rugby players who underwent a \nheavy training session followed by 3 different recovery methods, administered to \n3 subgroups of 10 athletes. We tested the use of active recovery consisting of \ncold water (5 degrees C) immersion of legs for 10 minutes either before (n = 10) \nor after (n = 10) cycling at 180 W for 10 minutes. In the whole group of \nathletes, measurements performed at rest and after training session and recovery \nshowed no differences in MCV and MSCV values. The difference between MCV and \nMSCV was significant in the whole group and in the subgroup performing passive \nrecovery, whereas the difference was not significant in the subgroups performing \nactive recovery. This finding indicates that the use of active recovery in the \ntop-level rugby players prevented the modifications of erythrocyte volume and \nshape. We outline that the values of the difference between MCV and MSCV was \nsignificantly modified in the whole group but the variations were not \nsignificant in the active recovery subgroups. The use of an index of erythrocyte \nshape modification (MCV - MSCV) can be very useful for evaluating sport \nhemolysis.\n\nDOI: 10.1532\/LH96.08004\nPMID: 18599431 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Repeated sprint ability, strength, muscle soreness and inflammatory \nmarkers were measured across the 48-h post-exercise period. Eleven male \nteam-sport athletes completed three 3-day testing trials, each separated by 2 \nweeks. On day 1, baseline measures of performance (10 m x 20 m sprints and \nisometric strength of quadriceps, hamstrings and hip flexors) were recorded. \nParticipants then performed 80 min of simulated team sports exercise followed by \na 20-m shuttle run test to exhaustion. Upon completion of the exercise, and 24h \nlater, participants performed one of the post-exercise recovery procedures for \n15 min. At 48 h post-exercise, the performance tests were repeated. Blood \nsamples and muscle soreness ratings were taken before and immediately after \npost-exercise, and at 24h and 48 h post-exercise. In comparison to the control \nand CWI treatments, COLD resulted in significantly lower (p<0.05) muscle \nsoreness ratings, as well as in reduced decrements to isometric leg extension \nand flexion strength in the 48-h post-exercise period. COLD also facilitated a \nmore rapid return to baseline repeated sprint performances. The only benefit of \nCWI over control was a significant reduction in muscle soreness 24h \npost-exercise. This study demonstrated that COLD following exhaustive simulated \nteam sports exercise offers greater recovery benefits than CWI or control \ntreatments.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.jsams.2007.12.011\nPMID: 18547863 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Strength trained males (n = 38) completed two \nexperimental trials separated by 8 months in a randomised crossover design; one \ntrial involved passive recovery (PAS, control), the other a specific \nhydrotherapy protocol for 72 h post-exercise; either: (1) cold water immersion \n(CWI: n = 12), (2) hot water immersion (HWI: n = 11) or (3) contrast water \ntherapy (CWT: n = 15). For each trial, subjects performed a DOMS-inducing leg \npress protocol followed by PAS or one of the hydrotherapy interventions for 14 \nmin. Weighted squat jump, isometric squat, perceived pain, thigh girths and \nblood variables were measured prior to, immediately after, and at 24, 48 and 72 \nh post-exercise. Squat jump performance and isometric force recovery were \nsignificantly enhanced (P < 0.05) at 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise following CWT \nand at 48 and 72 h post-exercise following CWI when compared to PAS. Isometric \nforce recovery was also greater (P < 0.05) at 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise \nfollowing HWI when compared to PAS. Perceived pain improved (P < 0.01) following \nCWT at 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise. Overall, CWI and CWT were found to be \neffective in reducing the physiological and functional deficits associated with \nDOMS, including improved recovery of isometric force and dynamic power and a \nreduction in localised oedema. While HWI was effective in the recovery of \nisometric force, it was ineffective for recovery of all other markers compared \nto PAS.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-007-0605-6\nPMID: 17978833 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty males (mean age 22.3 years, s = 3.3; height 1.80 \nm, s = 0.05; body mass 83.7 kg, s = 11.9) completed a 90-min intermittent \nshuttle run previously shown to result in marked muscle damage and soreness. \nAfter exercise, participants were randomly assigned to either 10 min cold-water \nimmersion (mean 10 degrees C, s = 0.5) or a non-immersion control group. Ratings \nof perceived soreness, changes in muscular function and efflux of intracellular \nproteins were monitored before exercise, during treatment, and at regular \nintervals up to 7 days post-exercise. Exercise resulted in severe muscle \nsoreness, temporary muscular dysfunction, and elevated serum markers of muscle \ndamage, all peaking within 48 h after exercise. Cryotherapy administered \nimmediately after exercise reduced muscle soreness at 1, 24, and 48 h (P < \n0.05). Decrements in isometric maximal voluntary contraction of the knee flexors \nwere reduced after cryotherapy treatment at 24 (mean 12%, s(x) = 4) and 48 h \n(mean 3%, s(x) = 3) compared with the control group (mean 21%, s(x) = 5 and mean \n14%, s(x) = 5 respectively; P < 0.05). Exercise-induced increases in serum \nmyoglobin concentration and creatine kinase activity peaked at 1 and 24 h, \nrespectively (P < 0.05).

They also completed a control trial \n(120 min rest in 19 degrees C air). Immediately following each CWI and control, \ncognitive and physical performance tests were performed in cold air (10 degrees \nC; CAE).\nRESULTS: Overall, the CWI protocol lowered rectal temperature by 0.3-1.0 degrees \nC. Mean skin temperature was approximately 26 degrees C and finger temperature \nwas approximately 15 degrees C during CAE. No statistical differences were \nobserved across trials for any cognitive test. On the physical performance \ntests, step test performance was degraded approximately 12% on CWI trials \ncompared with control, but there were no differences in manual dexterity, hand \ngrip strength, marksmanship, or pull-ups.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cognitive performance can be maintained \ndespite mild hypothermia, and that physical performance is related to local \ntissue temperature, not a moderately reduced core temperature.\n\nPMID: 17571656 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In a randomised \ncross-over design 20 junior representative rugby players (aged 19+\/-1 years) \nwere given either contrast temperature water therapy or active recovery after \nperforming a repeated sprint test. The test was then repeated 1h later to gauge \nthe effects of the two recovery methods on subsequent repetitive sprinting \nperformance. One week later, the two groups were reversed and the testing \nrepeated. The test consisted of ten 40-m sprints with a 30-s turn-around between \nsprints. Recovery consisted of 6 min slow jogging (6.8 km h(-1)) for the active \nrecovery group or 6 min of contrast temperature water therapy consisting of \nthree 1-min hip-height immersions in cold water (8-10 degrees C) alternated with \nthree 1-min hot water (38 degrees C) showers.

H.Morton@massey.ac.nz\n\nThe benefits of rapid recovery after intense exercise are widely recognised, and \nlactate elimination is one indicator of recovery rate. This study examined the \neffect of contrast (alternating hot and cold) water immersion (CWI) on the rate \nof plasma lactate decrease during recovery after intense anaerobic exercise. \nEleven subjects on each of two occasions undertook four successive 30-s Wingate \ntests separated by 30-s rest periods. On each occasion, plasma lactate \nconcentration during recovery was measured 5 min post-exercise and thereafter at \n5 min intervals for 30 min. On one occasion (determined randomly), the subjects \nrecovered passively (PR) on a recovery bed and, on the other, they alternated \npartial body immersion in hot (36 degrees C) and cold (12 degrees C) water \nbaths. Plasma lactate concentrations were analysed by repeated measures analysis \nof variance and by fitting a linear regression model, allowing for both gender \nand recovery mode differences. The rate of decrease in plasma lactate \nconcentration over the 30-min recovery period was significantly higher (p<0.001) \nin CWI; 0.28(+\/-0.02) mmol L(-1) min(-1) (CWI) compared to 0.22(+\/-0.02) mmol \nL(-1) min(-1) (PR). These values do not differ significantly between males and \nfemales. Contrast water immersion is a valid method of hastening plasma lactate \ndecrease during recovery after intense anaerobic exercise for both males and \nfemales. An approximately 1.8 mmol L(-1) difference between the two conditions \nmay be expected after 30 min. With differences among elite competitors as little \nas 1-2%, this reduction may be of practical significance.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.jsams.2006.09.004\nPMID: 17118706 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

P.Castle@bton.ac.uk\n\nWe used three techniques of precooling to test the hypothesis that heat strain \nwould be alleviated, muscle temperature (Tmu) would be reduced, and as a result \nthere would be delayed decrements in peak power output (PPO) during exercise in \nhot, humid conditions. Twelve male team-sport players completed four cycling \nintermittent sprint protocols (CISP). Each CISP consisted of twenty 2-min \nperiods, each including 10 s of passive rest, 5 s of maximal sprint against a \nresistance of 7.5% body mass, and 105 s of active recovery. The CISP, preceded \nby 20 min of no cooling (Control), precooling via an ice vest (Vest), cold water \nimmersion (Water), and ice packs covering the upper legs (Packs), was performed \nin hot, humid conditions (mean +\/- SE; 33.7 +\/- 0.3 degrees C, 51.6 +\/- 2.2% \nrelative humidity) in a randomized order. The rate of heat strain increase \nduring the CISP was faster in Control than Water and Packs (P < 0.01), but it \nwas similar to Vest. Packs and Water blunted the rise of Tmu until minute 16 and \nfor the duration of the CISP (40 min), respectively (P < 0.01). Reductions in \nPPO occurred from minute 32 onward in Control, and an increase in PPO by \napproximately 4% due to Packs was observed (main effect; P < 0.05). The method \nof precooling determined the extent to which heat strain was reduced during \nintermittent sprint cycling, with leg precooling offering the greater ergogenic \neffect on PPO than either upper body or whole body cooling.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00822.2005\nPMID: 16339344 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, the reasons for these changes remain unclear. \nThe present study aimed to quantify the mechanical properties of muscle and \ntendon during passive stretch and active contraction, and to investigate the \neffects of cooling and heating on the mechanical properties of muscle and \ntendon.\nMETHODS: Before and after these conditions, the elongation of the muscle \nfascicle, tendon and aponeurosis of the medial gastrocnemius muscle was directly \nmeasured by ultrasonography, while the ankle joint was passively moved within \nthe joint range of +15 to -30 deg (0 deg = neutral anatomic position; positive \nvalues for plantar flexion) and subjects performed ramp isometric plantar \nflexion up to the voluntary maximum.\nFINDINGS: While the muscle fascicle, tendon and aponeurosis stretched during \npassive dorsi-flexion, the elongation of the tendon was significantly greater \nthan that of the aponeurosis. During isometric contraction, the maximal \nelongation of the tendon was significantly greater than that of the aponeurosis. \nAfter cooling and heating, no significant changes in the elongation of muscle \nfascicle, tendon and aponeurosis were found during passive stretch. Similarly, \nafter both the immersions there were no changes in the relationship between the \nestimated muscle force and elongation of each structure (tendon-aponeurosis \ncomplex, tendon) during isometric contraction.\nINTERPRETATION: These results implied that the general application of icing and \nhot pack did not change the mechanical properties of muscle and tendon.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.clinbiomech.2004.11.005\nPMID: 15698702 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Subjects were then immersed in 7 degrees C water to \na Tes of 34.5 degrees C.\nRESULTS: Initial Tes cooling rates (initial approximately 6 min cooling) \ndiffered significantly among the treatment conditions (0.074 +\/- 0.045, 0.129 \n+\/- 0.076, and 0.348 +\/- 0.117 degrees C x min(-1) for control, active, and \npassive warming conditions, respectively); however, secondary cooling rates \n(rates following initial approximately 6 min cooling to the end of immersion) \nwere not different between treatments (average of 0.102 +\/- 0.085 degrees C x \nmin(-1)). Overall Tes cooling rates during the full immersion period differed \nsignificantly and were 0.067 +\/- 0.047, 0.085 +\/- 0.045, and 0.209 +\/- 0.131 \ndegrees C x min(-1) for control, active, and passive warming, respectively.\nDISCUSSION: These results suggest that prior warming by both active and, to a \ngreater extent, passive warming, may predispose a person to greater heat loss \nand to experience a larger decline in core temperature when subsequently exposed \nto cold water. Thus, functional time and possibly survival time could be reduced \nwhen cold water immersion is preceded by whole-body passive warming, and to a \nlesser degree by active warming.\n\nPMID: 15558995 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Fourteen males performed two pairs of treadmill runs to \nexhaustion at 120% and 90% of peak running speed (PRS) over a 4-hour period. \nACT, PAS or CTW was performed for 15-min after the first pair of treadmill runs. \nACT consisted of running at 40% PRS, PAS consisted of standing stationary and \nCTW consisted of alternating between 60-s cold (10 degrees C) and 120-s hot (42 \ndegrees C) water immersion. Run times were converted to time to cover set \ndistance using critical power. Type of recovery modality did not have a \nsignificant effect on change in time to cover 400 m (Mean +\/- SD; ACT 2.7 +\/- \n3.6 s, PAS 2.9 +\/- 4.2 s, CTW 4.2 +\/- 6.9 s), 1000 m (ACT 2.2 +\/- 4.0 s, PAS 4.8 \n+\/- 8.6 s, CTW 2.1 +\/- 7.2 s) or 5000 m (ACT 1.4 +\/- 29.0 s, PAS 16.7 +\/- 58.5 \ns, CTW 11.7 +\/- 33.0 s). Post exercise blood lactate concentration was lower in \nACT and CTW compared with PAS. Participants reported an increased perception of \nrecovery in the CTW compared with ACT and PAS. Blood pH was not significantly \ninfluenced by recovery modality.

In vivo immersions were conducted over 15 days (60-90 \nmin at 18 degrees C). Regional body temperatures and plasma leptin \nconcentrations were measured before and during immersion. Acute cold exposure \nsuppressed plasma leptin concentration (25 min: -14%, 60 min: -22%, P=0.0001), \nwhilst repeated cold-water immersion was associated with an increase of plasma \nleptin concentration relative to test day 1 (+19% day 8, +13% day 15, overall \nP=0.03). Leptin secretion in vitro decreased 3.7-fold as the incubation \ntemperature decreased from 37 degrees to 27 degrees C ( P=0.001). In a \ncompartmental model of leptin turnover in vivo, the measured (local) temperature \neffect on leptin secretion in vitro was more than able to account for the \nobserved cold-induced decrease in leptin concentration in vivo. We therefore \nconclude that acute and repeated cold-water immersions have separate and \nopposing effects on circulating leptin concentrations in humans. Under our \nexperimental conditions, the local effects of reduced subcutaneous adipose \ntissue temperature may be a more important contributor to the acute effects \nobserved in vivo, than the sympathetically mediated suppression of leptin \nsecretion.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-004-1084-7\nPMID: 15045507 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This phenomenon is \nexplained through a theoretical analysis of heat distribution in the body \napplied to an experiment involving cold water immersion. Six healthy and fit men \n(mean +\/- SD of age = 37.5 +\/- 6.5 yr, height = 1.79 +\/- 0.07 m, mass = 81.8 +\/- \n9.5 kg, body fat = 17.3 +\/- 4.2%, maximal O2 uptake = 46.9 +\/- 5.5 l\/min) were \nimmersed in water ranging from 16.4 to 24.1 degrees C for up to 10 h. Core \ntemperature (Tco) underwent an insignificant transient rise during the first \nhour of immersion, then declined steadily for several hours, although no \nsubject's Tco reached 35 degrees C. Despite the continued decrease in Tco, \nshivering had reached a steady state of approximately 2 x resting metabolism. \nHeat debt peaked at 932 +\/- 334 kJ after 2 h of immersion, indicating the \nattainment of heat balance, but unexpectedly proceeded to decline at \napproximately 48 kJ\/h, indicating a recovery of mean body temperature. These \nobservations were rationalized by introducing a third compartment of the body, \ncomprising fat, connective tissue, muscle, and bone, between the core (viscera \nand vessels) and skin. Temperature change in this \"mid region\" can account for \nthe incongruity between the body's heat debt and the changes in only the core \nand skin temperatures. The mid region temperature decreased by 3.7 +\/- 1.1 \ndegrees C at maximal heat debt and increased slowly thereafter. The reversal in \nheat debt might help explain why shivering drive failed to respond to a \ncontinued decrease in Tco, as shivering drive might be modulated by changes in \nbody heat content.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.01195.2002\nPMID: 12639852 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-eight male \nsubjects [mean (SD) 23.8 (1.8) years] were randomly assigned to the control \n(COTG, n=10), cold-water immersion (CWIG, n=9), and double-cold-water immersion \ngroups (DCWIG, n=9). The cold-water immersion (15 min) was administered to the \nsubjects' legs after calf-raise exercise (CWIG: after recording initial \npost-exercise measures, DCWIG: after recording initial and 24 h post-exercise \nmeasures). Magnetic resonance T2-weighted images were obtained to calculate the \nT2 relaxation time (T2) of the triceps surae muscle before, immediately after, \nand at the following times post-exercise: 20, 40, and 60 min, and 24, 48, 96 and \n168 h. In addition, the ankle joint range of motion, serum creatine kinase and \nlactate dehydrogenase, and muscle soreness level were investigated before and \nafter exercise. In all groups, significant T2 elevations in the gastrocnemius \nmuscle appeared from immediately after to 60 min after exercise (P<0.05). \nThereafter, COTG showed significantly re-elevated T2 levels in the gastrocnemius \nat 96-168 h post-exercise (P<0.05), while CWIG and DCWIG showed significantly \nsmaller T2 values than the COTG at 96 h post-exercise (P<0.05). In addition, \nCOTG showed larger increases in serum enzymes at 96 h post-exercise (not \nsignificant) and significantly greater muscle soreness levels at 48 h \npost-exercise (P<0.05) than the cooling groups. The results of this study may \nsuggest that cooling has no dramatic effect, but some minor effects on reducing \nexercise-induced muscle edema in the subacute phase and relieving the extent of \nthe damaged muscle cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-002-0749-3\nPMID: 12627305 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

PTP was smallest in cold exposure 5 s \npost-tetanus, but persisted throughout the 12 min test period, whereas PTP had \nsubsided by 6 min post-tetanus in control and warm exposures. M-wave amplitude \ninitially decreased after exposure to warm water, recovered, then decreased \nagain by 11 min post-tetanus. In contrast, exposure to cold had no initial \neffect but did increase the M-wave amplitude during the last half of the 12 min \ntest period, similar to that seen in the control. The greatest immediate \ndecrease in rise time and half-relaxation time was observed in the control; \nhowever, by 12 min post-tetanus warm exposure showed the greatest increase in \nrise time and half-relaxation time above pre-tetanus values. The decrease in the \nunpotentiated twitch torque with cooling in human dorsiflexors is typical for \nmuscles with a predominance of type I (slow) fibres. The effect of cold on PTP \nis similar to that seen previously in mammalian muscles with a predominance of \ntype II (fast) fibres, although the underlying mechanism of the cooling effect \nappears to differ.\n\nPMID: 11201501 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

It was found that the \nthermoregulatory functions of winter swimmers differ from those of \nnon-cold-adapted subjects. As evident from the relationship between rectal \ntemperature and the magnitude of cold thermogenesis, in controls a significant \npart of cold thermogenesis during the early phase of cooling was induced by \nchanges in peripheral temperature input, while in the late phase of cooling it \nwas the central temperature input which was mainly engaged in induction of cold \nthermogenesis. In winter swimmers the magnitude of cold thermogenesis was solely \nrelated to changes in rectal temperature, indicating the predominance of the \ncentral temperature input in activation of heat production mechanisms. The \nthermoregulatory threshold for induction of cold thermogenesis was lowered (by \n0.34 C), but the apparent hypothalamic thermosensitivity was the same as in \nnon-cold-adapted subjects. These differences are indicative of adaptation of \nthermoregulatory control centres. Additionally, the activity of thermoregulatory \neffectors was also changed. Shivering was induced later during cooling (after 40 \nmin) in winter swimmers than in controls, which suggests an important \nparticipation of non-shivering thermogenesis in the early thermogenic response. \nWinter swimmers also showed bradycardia and a greater reduction in plasma volume \nduring cooling. The data indirectly indicate restriction of heat loss from the \nbody. Only a non-significant increase in quantity of subcutaneous fat was \nobserved in winter swimmers. Thus, winter swimmers were able to survive a \nsignificantly greater temperature gradient between body and environment than \nnon-cold-adapted subjects by modifying the sensory functions of hypothalamic \nthermoregulatory centres to lower heat loss and produce less heat during cold \nexposure. Additionally, the capacity of the total cold thermogenesis due to \npotentiation of non-shivering heat production was also increased. Heat produced \ndue to thermogenic action of adrenaline may represent more than a quarter of the \ntotal cold thermogenesis. In conclusion, the data suggest that winter swimmers \nexhibit metabolic, hypothermic and insulative types of cold adaptation.\n\nPMID: 10825419 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Pretreatment with exercise in 18 degrees C water augmented the \nleukocyte, granulocyte, and monocyte response. These results indicate that acute \ncold exposure has immunostimulating effects and that, with thermal clamping, \npretreatment with physical exercise can enhance this response. Increases in \nlevels of circulating norepinephrine may account for the changes observed during \ncold exposure and their modification by changes in initial status.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/jappl.1999.87.2.699\nPMID: 10444630 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After performing a bout of damage-inducing eccentric exercise (eight \nsets of five maximal reciprocal contractions at 0.58 rad x s(-1)) of the elbow \nflexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, 15 females aged 22.0+\/-2.0 years (mean +\/- \ns) were allocated to a control group (no treatment, n = 7) or a cryotherapy \ngroup (n = 8). Subjects in the cryotherapy group immersed their exercised arm in \ncold water (15 degrees C) for 15 min immediately after eccentric exercise and \nthen every 12 h for 15 min for a total of seven sessions. Muscle tenderness, \nplasma creatine kinase activity, relaxed elbow angle, isometric strength and \nswelling (upper arm circumference) were measured immediately before and for 3 \ndays after eccentric exercise. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < \n0.05) main effects for time for all variables, with increases in muscle \ntenderness, creatine kinase activity and upper arm circumference, and decreases \nin isometric strength and relaxed elbow angle. There were significant \ninteractions (P<0.05) of group x time for relaxed elbow angle and creatine \nkinase activity. Relaxed elbow angle was greater and creatine kinase activity \nlower for the cryotherapy group than the controls on days 2 and 3 following the \neccentric exercise. We conclude that although cold water immersion may reduce \nmuscle stiffness and the amount of post-exercise damage after strenuous \neccentric activity, there appears to be no effect on the perception of \ntenderness and strength loss, which is characteristic after this form of \nactivity.\n\nDOI: 10.1080\/026404199366136\nPMID: 10362390 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The precooling trial (PC) \ninvolved lowering body core temperature (-0.5 degrees C rectal temperature, Tre) \nin water before swimming. The control trial (CON) was identical except no \nprecooling was performed. Water temperature and environmental conditions were \nmaintained at 25.6 degrees C and 26.6 degrees C\/60% rh, respectively, throughout \nall testing.\nRESULTS: Mean time to precool was 31+\/-8 min and average time to reach baseline \nTre during cycling was 9+\/-7 min. Oxygen uptake (VO2), HR, skin temperature \n(Tsk), Tre, RPE, and thermal sensation (TS) were recorded following the swim \nsegment and throughout cycling. No significant differences in mean body (Tb) or \nTsk were noted between PC and CON, but a significant difference (P < 0.05) in \nTre between treatments was noted through the early phases of cycling. No \nsignificant differences were reported in HR, VO2, RPE, TS, or sweat rate (SR) \nbetween treatments. Body heat storage (S) was negative following swimming in \nboth PC (-92+\/-6 W x m2) and CON (-66+\/-9 W x m2). A greater S occurred in PC \n(109+\/-6 W x m2) vs CON (79+\/-4 W x m2) during cycling (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Precooling attenuated the rise in Tre, but this effect was \ntransient. Therefore, precooling is not recommended before a triathlon under \nsimilar environmental conditions.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/00005768-199902000-00008\nPMID: 10063814 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Treatment \nconsisted of complete body immersion in cold or warm water baths. Fifteen \nvolunteers were investigated by means of transcranial Doppler sonography and a \nservo-controlled noninvasive device for blood pressure measuring. One group of 8 \nvolunteers (mean age, 27.2+\/-3.5 yr; gender, 3 females\/5 males) was subjected to \ncold baths of 22 degrees C for 20 min Another group of 7 volunteers (mean age, \n52.1+\/-8.5 yr; gender, 4 females\/3 males) took hyperthermic baths at rising \nwater temperatures from 36 degrees to 42 degrees C, increased by 1 degree C \nevery 5 min. Each volunteer in both groups underwent autoregulation tests two to \nfour times before, during, and after the thermic bath. Dynamic autoregulation \nwas measured by the response of cerebral blood flow velocity to a transient \ndecrease of the mean arterial blood pressure, induced by rapid deflation of \nthigh cuffs. The autoregulation index, i.e., a measure of the speed of change of \ncerebral autoregulation, was used to quantify the response. Further parameters \nwere core temperature, blood pressure (mm Hg) and CO2et. During hypothermic \nbaths, core temperature decreased by 0.3 degrees C (P = 0.001), measured between \npreliminary phase and the end of the bath; the autoregulation index decreased \nsignificantly (P < 0.05) from 5.3 before the bath to 4.25 during the bath. \nDuring hyperthermic baths, the autoregulation index increased from 6.0 to 7.5 \nand 8.9 (P < 0.001), with an increase of core temperature of 0.4 degrees C. The \nmain cerebral autoregulation system is dependent on changes of core temperature, \nprovoked by hypothermic or hyperthermic whole-body thermostimulus. Application \nof hyperthermic baths increased the autoregulation index, and hypothermic baths \ndecreased the autoregulation index. Further studies are needed to prove the \npositive effects of thermo-stimulating water applications on cerebral \nhemodynamics in patients with cerebral diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/00002060-199901000-00009\nPMID: 9923427 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

When immersed naked, the maximum responses are \ninitiated in water at 10 degrees C, with smaller responses being observed \nfollowing immersion in water at 15 degrees C. Habituation of the initial \nresponses can be achieved following repeated immersions, but the specificity of \nthis response with regard to water temperature is not known. Thirteen healthy \nmale volunteers were divided into a control (C) group (n = 5) and a habituation \n(H) group (n = 8). Each subject undertook two 3-min head-out immersions in water \nat 10 degrees C wearing swimming trunks. These immersions took place at a \ncorresponding time of day with 4 days separating the two immersions. In the \nintervening period the C group were not exposed to cold water, while the H group \nundertook another six, 3-min, head-out immersions in water at 15 degrees C. \nRespiratory rate (fR), inspiratory minute volume (VI) and heart rate (fH) were \nmeasured continuously throughout each immersion. Following repeated immersions \nin water at 15 degrees C, the fR, VI and fH responses of the H group over the \nfirst 30 s of immersion were reduced (P < 0.01) from 33.3 breaths x min(-1), \n50.5 l x min(-1) and 114 beats x min(-1) respectively, to 19.8 breaths x min(-1) \n26.41 x min(-1) and 98 beats x min(-1), respectively. In water at 10 degrees C \nthese responses were reduced (P < 0.01) from 47.3 breaths x min(-1), 67.61 x \nmin(-1) and 128 beats x min(-1) to 24.0 breaths x min(-1), 29.5 l x min(-1) and \n109 beats x min(-1), respectively over a corresponding period of immersion. \nSimilar reductions were observed during the last 2.5 min of immersions. The \ninitial responses of the C group were unchanged. It is concluded that \nhabituation of the cold shock response can be achieved by immersion in warmer \nwater than that for which protection is required.

Eight men were immersed \n(2 h) in 20 degrees C water three times (0700, 1100, and 1500) in 1 day \n(Repeat). This trial was compared with single immersions (Control) conducted at \nthe same times of day. Before Repeat exposures at 1100 and 1500, rewarming was \nemployed to standardize initial rectal temperature. The following observations \nwere made in the Repeat relative to the Control trial: 1) rectal temperature was \nlower and heat debt was higher (P < 0.05) at 1100; 2) metabolic heat production \nwas lower (P < 0.05) at 1100 and 1500; 3) subjects perceived the Repeat trial as \nwarmer at 1100.

This data analysis revisited this hypothesis and \ncompared previously published data with unpublished data from our laboratory on \nthose subjects that were terminated from cold water immersion early because of a \nreduction in rectal temperature (T(re)) - 35 degrees C. T(re), mean skin \ntemperature (T(sk)), and oxygen uptake (VO2) were recorded at 5, 30, 60, and 90 \nmin of immersion and were used to calculate 3delta readings for each exposure, \nthat is, deltaT(30) minus T5, T60 minus T(30), and T(90) minus T(60). Single \ngroup t-tests were used to examine differences in deltaT(re), deltaT(sk), and \ndeltaVO2 between the published data (PD) group and the individual subjects who \nwere terminated early (TE) at each of three water temperatures (18 degrees C, 22 \ndegrees C, 26 degrees C). For deltaVO2 the TE subjects were dichotomized by \nfatness (low percent fat, 8%-12%; or high percent fat, 18%-22%) to account for \nthe VO2 differences between these groups (i.e., fatness) during cold water \nimmersion. deltaT(re) was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in TE subjects \ncompared with PD subjects at all timepoints for 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C. \nAt 22 degrees C, the TE subject exhibited a significantly greater (p < 0.05) \ndecrease in deltaT(re) than the PD group at 90 min of immersion only. No \nsignificant (p > 0.05) differences in deltaT(sk) between the PD and TE groups \nwere detected for any of the exposure temperatures over all time points. No \ndifference (p > 0.05) between PD subjects and TE subjects for deltaVO2 was \nexhibited at any time point at any temperature. It appears that with respect to \nthe TE group, elevations in VO2 were comparable to the PD group, but the TE \ngroup was unable to maintain T(re) during cold water immersion. In conclusion, \nfrom these data it appears that shivering thermogenesis does in part enhance the \nindividual's ability to maintain T(re); however, as evidenced in the TE group, \nit also appears that the alterations in shivering thermogenesis for certain \nindividuals may not be great enough to offset heat loss.\n\nDOI: 10.1580\/1080-6032(1997)008[0003:dsteti]2.3.co;2\nPMID: 11990135 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In \ncold-exposed animals, hypoxia increases core temperature (Tco) cooling rate and \nsuppresses shivering thermogenesis. In humans, the experimental effects of \nhypoxia on thermoregulation are equivocal. Also, the effect of hypoxia has not \nbeen separated from that of hypocapnia consequent to hypoxic hyperventilation. \nTo determine the isolated effects of hypoxia on warm and cold thermoregulatory \nresponses and core cooling during mild cold stress, we examined the Tco \nthresholds for sweating, vasoconstriction, and shivering as well as the core \ncooling rates of eight subjects immersed in 28 degrees C water under eucapnic \nconditions. On 2 separate days, subjects exercised on an underwater cycle \nergometer to elevate Tco above the sweating threshold. They then rested and \ncooled until they shivered vigorously. Subjects inspired humidified room air \nduring the control trial. For the eucapnic hypoxia trial, they inspired 12% \nO2-balance N2 with CO2 added to maintain eucapnia. Eucapnic hypoxia lowered the \nTco thresholds for vasoconstriction and shivering by 0.14 and 0.19 degrees C, \nrespectively, and increased core cooling rate by 33% (1.83 vs. 1.38 degrees \nC\/h). These results demonstrate that eucapnic hypoxia enhances the core cooling \nrate in humans during mild cold stress. This may be attributed in part to a \ndelay in the onset of vasoconstriction and shivering as well as increased \nrespiratory heat loss during hypoxic hyperventilation.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/jappl.1996.80.2.422\nPMID: 8929579 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The independent \ncontributions of local (peripheral) and\/or whole body (central) cooling are not \nknown. Therefore, a protocol was developed in which the arm and the rest of the \nbody could be independently cooled.\nMETHODS: Biceps temperature (Tmus), at a depth of 20 mm, and esophageal \ntemperature (Tes) were measured. Six subjects were immersed to the clavicles in \na tank (body tank) of water under 3 conditions: 1) cold body-cold arm (CB-CA); \n2) warm body-cold arm (WB-CA); and 3) cold body-warm arm (CB-WA). In the latter \ntwo conditions, subjects placed their dominant arm in a separate (arm) tank. \nWater temperature (Tw) in each tank was independently controlled. In conditions \nrequiring cold body and\/or cold arm, Tw in the appropriate tanks was 8 degrees \nC. In conditions requiring warm body and\/or warm arm, Tw in the appropriate \ntanks was adjusted between 29 and 38 degrees C to maintain body\/arm temperature \nat baseline values. A battery of 6 tests, requiring fine or gross motor \nmovements, were performed immediately before immersion and after 15, 45, and 70 \nminutes of immersion.\nRESULTS: In CB-CA, Tes decreased from an average of 37.2 to 35.6 degrees C and \nTmus decreased from 34.6 to 22.0 degrees C. In WB-CA, Tmus decreased to 18.1 \ndegrees C (Tes = 37.1 degrees C), and in CB-WA, Tes decreased to 35.8 degrees C \n(Tmus = 34.5 degrees C). By the end of immersion, there were significant \ndecrements (43-85%) in the performance of all tests in CB-CA and WB-CA (p < \n0.0002); scores for each test were similar in these two conditions. There was no \nsignificant change in scores throughout the CB-WA condition. In both conditions \nwith arm cooling (i.e., WB-CA and CB-CA), Tmus accounted for 85-98% of the \nvariance in all tests. When the core was cooled in the CB-WA condition, Tes was \nsignificantly correlated to scores in only two tests (accounted for 90 and 93% \nof the variance) although the actual effect was small. In the CB-CA condition, \npartial correlations indicated that Tes accounted for 4-10% of the variance in \nscores of 4 tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cooling of the body and\/or the arm elicits large \ndecrements in finger, hand and arm performance. The decrements are due almost \nentirely to the local effects of arm tissue cooling.\n\nPMID: 8526834 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Percent calories utilized \nindicated that for these experimental conditions the predominant substrate \nutilized between the LF and HF groups across time was derived from carbohydrate. \nIn addition, VO2 was greater (p = .0004) in the LF than HF group, and the latter \nwas greater (p = .0013) in the 18 degrees C group versus the 26 degrees C group \nand increased across time (p = .0001); that is, VO2 after 5 min of immersion was \nless than at 60 and 90 min, and values obtained after 30 min of immersion were \nless than those at 90 min of immersion. Based on these data, it appears that the \nLF group would expend more calories (308.9 vs. 199.9 kcal, respectively) and \nmore likely derive these calories from a carbohydrate source than the HF group \nduring 90 min of cold water immersion. It would appear beneficial to consider a \nfeeding supplement for the low-fat individual if immersion was in a more thermal \nstressful environment or extended for a protracted period of time.\n\nDOI: 10.1580\/1080-6032(1995)006[0295:iocwio]2.3.co;2\nPMID: 11990094 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

It was hypothesized that training in hot water would \nhave greater effects on muscle glycogen use and blood lactate accumulation \nduring exercise than training in cold water. Eighteen men exercised at 60% of \nmaximal oxygen uptake while immersed in hot (n = 9) or cold water (n = 9) for 1 \nh, 5 days\/wk, for 8 wk. Training in hot water (35 degrees C) potentiated body \ntemperature increases during exercise, and training in cold water (20 degrees C) \nblunted body temperature increases during exercise. Before and after training, \ncardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory responses and muscle glycogen and blood \nlactate changes were assessed during a 1-h exercise trial in hot water and, on a \nseparate day using the same intensity, in cold water. Oxygen uptake was similar \nfor all trials, averaging 2.0 +\/- 0.1 l\/min. It was observed that 1) training \nreduced glycogen use and lactate accumulation during exercise, with no \ndifference between cold and hot water training groups in the magnitude of this \neffect; 2) lactate accumulation during exercise was the same in hot water as in \ncold water; and 3) skin temperature decreased more rapidly during cold-water \nexercise after than before training, with no difference between cold and hot \nwater training groups in the magnitude of this effect. Thus, exercise-induced \nbody temperature increases are not an important stimulus for glycogen-sparing \neffects and blunted lactate accumulation associated with endurance training.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/jappl.1995.78.3.793\nPMID: 7775320 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
